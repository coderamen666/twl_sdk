The loadrun command loads and executes NITRO srl files associated with IS-NITRO-EMULATOR.
It can be run from the command line without starting the debugger, and can be forcibly terminated with specified conditions.
----------------------------------------------------------------
How to use:
Specify the srl filename after loadrun.
At that time, options can be specified between loadrun and the srl filename. See the following for options.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Explanation of options.
--version
	Displays the version.
-h, --help
	Displays help.
-q, --quiet
	Runs in Quiet mode.
	OS_Printf() from the DS is not displayed.
-v, --verbose
	Runs in Verbose mode.
	Displays various information.
-L, --list
	Displays a list of connected devices.
	For example, a list such as the following is displayed.
	---- Connected devices:
	  0: [NITROUSB]  IS-NITRO-EMULATOR serial:04070680
	  1: [NITROUSB]  IS-NITRO-EMULATOR serial:04070682
	  2: [NITROUSB]  IS-NITRO-EMULATOR serial:04070683
	3 device(s) found.
	The [NITROUSB] portion is one of the device types specified with the &ndash;d option. serial is the serial number specified with the &ndash;s option.
When IS-NITRO-DEBUGGER is run, already-connected devices are not displayed on this list.
-l, --lap
	Displays the elapsed time since startup on each row when OS_Printf() data is displayed. Internally, operations are processed in units of seconds, so there may be slight errors of a few tenths of a second.
	The example below shows what is displayed. The {x:xx} portion is the portion added by this option.
	{0:01}Program started
	{0:01}--- heap init
	{0:02}x=14 y=50
	{0:04}x=15 y=20
	{0:04}
-d, --type=DEVICE
	Specifies device types. CGBUSB, CGBSCSI, NITROUSB, or NITROUIC can be specified.
The first machine found with the device specified here becomes the target for that action.
-s, --serial=SERIAL
	Specifies device serial numbers. The specified value is a 10-digit number, and is the same as the serial number displayed with the &ndash;L option.
	When the number 04070680 is displayed in a list, the first 0 can be omitted as in 4070680.
The first machine found with the serial number specified here becomes the target for that action.
	It is okay to specify only one of either &ndash;d or &ndash;s.
It is also okay to specify both, or neither.
If no specification is made, the first machine found becomes the target.
-t, --timeout=SECOND
	Specifies a display timeout.
	After receiving the last OS_Printf() data, if the next display does not happen for the specified time, the operation is forcibly terminated.
-T, --exec-timeout=SECOND
	Specifies an execution timeout.
	Forcibly terminates after the specified period of time passes from when debugger loads and executes an srl file.
-a, --abort-string=STRING
	Specifies a termination character string.
	-a=ABORT  -a="ABORT"   -a ABORT -a "ABORT" 
--abort-string=ABORT --abort-string "ABORT"
are all examples of possible specifications.
	Matching checks the beginning of the displayed character string. No determination will be made until a line feed is encountered. Gaps between displays are fine.
	For example, if the termination character string is &ldquo;ABORT," any of the following
	OS_Printf("   ABORT\n")
	OS_Printf("ABORTING\n")
	OS_Printf("ABOR");OS_Sleep(1000);OS_Printf("T\n");
	will result in termination, but the following:
	OS_Printf("   ABORT\n")
	OS_Printf("ABO\nRT\n")
	OS_Printf("A B O R T\n")
	...will not cause termination. In addition,
	OS_Printf("ABORT")
	will not immediately terminate because a line break has not been added.
	If a line break code such as OS_Printf(&ldquo;\n&rdquo;) or OS_Printf(&ldquo;  SOON\n&rdquo;) comes afterward, it will terminate.
-c, --card-slot=SWITCH
	Specify the lock setting of the card slot to ON or OFF.
	OFF is used if unspecified.
-C, --cartridge-slot=SWITCH
	Specify the lock setting of the cartridge to ON or OFF.
	OFF is used if unspecified.
