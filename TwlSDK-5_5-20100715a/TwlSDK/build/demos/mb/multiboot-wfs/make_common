# Because the MB library samples use the multiboot functionality, multiple development units with the same communications environment (wired or wireless) are required.
# The mb_child.bin sample program in the $TwlSDK/bin/ARM9-TS/Release directory provides the same functionality as a commercial system that is a multiboot child. Load this binary on other systems just like a sample program and run them together.
