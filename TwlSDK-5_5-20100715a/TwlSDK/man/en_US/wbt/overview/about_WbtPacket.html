The figure below shows the packet flow during download and upload when using WBT.<BR> <FONT color="red"><B>Note: Since half-duplex communications are used between parents and children, if an upload and download occur at the same time, the upload takes priority from the child's perspective.</B></FONT><BR>

<P>
An upload is essentially the same as a download, but the parent and child actions are reversed. For an upload, the child must notify the parent by sending block information using <CODE>WBT_PutUserData</CODE>. (If the upload occurs immediately after <CODE>RequestSync</CODE> and the blocks to upload will not change, the <a href="../command/WBT_GetBlockInfo.html"><CODE>WBT_GetBlockInfo</CODE></a> function may be called as the <CODE>RequestSync</CODE> receive callback.)<BR><BR> The following figure shows the packet flow exchanged between parent and child during upload.<BR>
