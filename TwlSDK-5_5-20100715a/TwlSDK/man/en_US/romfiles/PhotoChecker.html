<H2>Overview</H2>
<P>
<CODE>PhotoChecker</CODE> is a TWL application that checks the photo region in the TWL system.<br>Using this tool, you can check whether any illegal files exist that were not written via the TCL library.
</P>


<H2>Execution</H2>
<H3></H3>
<P>
Run it in one of the following ways.
</P>
<ul>
<li>Use the IS-TWL-DEBUGGER software to run <CODE>PhotoChecker.srl</CODE>
<li>Write <CODE>PhotoChecker.srl</CODE> to a TWL Game Card and then run it
</ul>
<P>
When it runs, the images that exist in and below <CODE>photo:</CODE> appear on the upper screen, and the filenames appear one after the other on the lower screen. If any item in or under <CODE>photo:</CODE> is in an illegal state, the upper screen turns red. If everything is in normal state, the upper screen turns green. <br>The following are considered illegal states.
</P>
<ul>
<li>When the management file does not exist (perhaps because the Nintendo DSi Cameras have never been activated) but the other files exist
<li>When the management file is invalid
<li>When the written file existed without going through the Nintendo DSi Camera and TCL
<li>When the file written via the Nintendo DSi Camera and TCL was deleted without going through the Nintendo DSi Camera
</ul>
<P>
Specifically, the following error messages are displayed.<br> <br>
