<H3><A name="note36-19" id="note36-19">Note 36-19: (WM) Changed Specifications Regarding NULL Response from Children during MP Communication</A></H3>
<P>Specifications were changed so that a Null response would not be returned from children in the middle of MP communication as described in <a href="changelog-nitro.html#note30-06">Note 30-06</a>. However, this would occasionally result in unstable operations depending on the environment. Consequently, the change described in <a href="changelog-nitro.html#note30-06">Note 30-06</a> has been canceled and the previous specification has been restored.<br> <br> In addition, instead of allowing Null responses from child devices, if a parent device receives a Null response from a child device, it assumes that the child device had a communication failure. <br>Since the <CODE>WM_SetMPInterval</CODE> function has been added, excess load problems on the child side should not result even if changes are made later on to allow Null responses to be returned.

<H3><A name="note36-20" id="note36-20">Note 36-20: (WM) Changed WMGameInfo Structure Definitions</A></H3>
<P>The definition of the <CODE>WMGameInfo</CODE> structure has been changed. The version field was eliminated and the name was changed to <CODE>magicNumber</CODE>. The <CODE>magicNumber</CODE> field is fixed at 0x0001 when used as a DS beacon. In addition, the ver field has been established using one byte from reserved memory. <br> In the current version, the <CODE>ver</CODE> field is always 0. In the future, this will increase as the format of the <CODE>WMGameInfo</CODE> structure changes. To ensure backward compatibility in the future, there must be no restriction on operations based on checking the <CODE>ver</CODE> field. Due to these changes, it is necessary to re-write programs that accessed <CODE>WMGameInfo.version</CODE>. <br> In addition, the name of the field <CODE>gameNameCount_attribute</CODE> has been changed to <CODE>attribute</CODE>.

Due to restrictions on the implementation, these values must be set either in the range 220 to 260 or the range 0 to 190.<br> The ARM7 operates actively during communication processing and frequently blocks the ARM9 from accessing main memory.

<H3><A name="note33-22" id="note33-22">Note 33-22: (WM) Added a Function to Configure the Send Size for MP Communications</A></H3>
<P>Until now, the size of transmissions sent using MP communication have been fixed at values given by the <CODE>parentMaxSize</CODE> and <CODE>childMaxSize</CODE> fields of the <CODE>WMParentParam</CODE> structure that the parent sets with the <CODE>WM_SetParentParameter</CODE> function before communication starts. The parent send size and child send size can be set using the functions <CODE>WM_SetMPParentSize </CODE>and <CODE>WM_SetMPChildSize</CODE>, respectively.<br>The send size of the parent and child are initialized to the values set for <CODE>parentMaxSize</CODE> and <CODE>childMaxSize</CODE> in the <CODE>WMParentParam</CODE> structure when the parent executes the <CODE>WM_StartParent</CODE> function. Smaller values than these can be set using the <CODE>WM_SetMPParentSize</CODE> and <CODE>WM_SetMPChildSize</CODE> functions. However, the default initial values cannot be exceeded. Setting the parent send size on the child side is meaningless. However, the setting for the child send size is used to overwrite the child send size setting on the parent side every time MP communications are carried out.<br>There is not much advantage in changing the setting for parent transmissions since the smaller the amount of data, the shorter the radio signal output. Still, the child side always sends out a radio signal with the number of bytes designated in <CODE>childMaxSize</CODE>. Thus, by reconfiguring the necessary size, the transmission time can be reduced and communications can be stabilized. Given the current implementation, if an amount of data larger than the send size (as modified using these functions) has already been configured by the <CODE>WM_SetMPDataToPort</CODE> function, that data will not be sent. Instead, it will just continue to collect in the send queue.</P>

Throughput can be increased by adjusting this value. However, throughput may also be worsened due to dropped data if the MP communication interval for the parent is shorter than the time it takes the children to process the received data. Generating unnecessary resends will also adversely affect the bandwidth efficiency.<br>

<P>We implemented thread destructors that call preset functions when a thread is terminated. <br> The destructors are set using the <CODE>OS_SetThreadDestructor</CODE> function. <br> <br> Thread destructors are called under the following circumstances:
<ul>
<li>A thread's task has executed all the way to the end.
<li>A thread has been terminated with the <CODE>OS_ExitThread</CODE> function.
<li>A thread has been terminated by another thread with the <CODE>OS_KillThread*</CODE> function.
<li>A thread has terminated itself using the <CODE>OS_KillThread*</CODE> function.
</ul>
Thread destructors are not called under the following circumstances:
<ul>
<li>A thread has been terminated by another thread with the <CODE>OS_DestroyThread</CODE> function.
<li>A thread has terminated itself using the <CODE>OS_DestroyThread</CODE> function.
</ul>
We added a thread destructor demo. It is <CODE>$NitroSDK/build/demos/os/thread-7</CODE>.

However, this could affect applications that use this constant as a build switch for changing behavior (such as sample demos that use the microphone) .<br> When <code>NITRO_TS_VERSION</code> is specified as the environment variable, <code>SDK_TS_VERSION</code> takes the specified value, not the default value.<br> <br> NITRO-SDK has an OS and an SPI library prepared for every <CODE>TS_VERSION</CODE>.<br> This is relevant when the development environment uses the TS breadboard and so on, with the owner information in an old save format.

We implemented a mechanism to add new language codes and added Chinese as an extended language code. We are currently drafting guidelines for the creation of applications that support Chinese.</P>


<H3><A name="note26-06" id="note26-06">Note 26-06: (SND) Added instrument release invalidation function</A></H3>
<P>
A feature was added so that the instrument will ignore the specified note length and continue to play to the end of the waveform data if <code>SND_BANK_DISABLE_RELEASE</code> <code>(=255)</code> is specified for the release field of the <code>SNDInstData</code> structure.


<H3><A name="note26-07" id="note26-07">Note 26-07: (WBT) Corrected sample demo.</A></H3>
<P>
The following revisions were made to the <code>$NitroSDK/build/demos/wireless_shared/wfs</code> sample module and the <code>$NitroSDK/build/demos/wbt/wbt-fs</code> sample demo:

<ul>
<li>
There was a problem where the program would stop when the <code>WFS_End</code> function was called from an interrupt handle. This was fixed. We added a note in the header file of the WFS sample module indicating that it cannot be called from an interrupt handler.
<li>
When <code>WFS_End</code> function was called after the WM library has ended, the port callback failed to release internally and execution stopped with an error, as made in the specifications. However, we changed the specification to simply ignore this section.
<li>
Check code is added so that, since the WFS sample module requires the thread system, the message is output and stops with a compile error if <code>SDK_NO_THREAD</code> is defined during the build.</P>
</ul>


<H3><A name="note26-08" id="note26-08">Note 26-08: (WM) Corrected sample demo.</A></H3>
<P>
With the samples that did not call the WcFinish function even though the WcInit function of the WC sample module could be called more than once, the correction was made so that these two functions are called properly. We revised the following demos so that the two functions are properly paired:
<ul>
<li>$NitroSDK/build/demos/wbt/wbt-fs

<P>We revised the memory map and expanded the MainRAM area that is allocated to ARM9 by default. Previously the area allocated to DTCM started at 0x27C0000, but it now starts at 0x27E0000. Also, the MainRAM area allocated to ARM9 was expanded from 0x2000000&ndash;0x23BFFFF to 0x2000000&ndash;0x23DFFFF. (This increases its size by 128 KB.) The MainRAM  area allocated to ARM7 is now  0x27E0000&ndash;0x27FEFFF. When the main memory size was 4 MB, under the default protection region setting, the ARM7 program area from 0x23E0000&ndash;0x23FFFFF was enabled for reading and writing from the ARM9. We changed the position of protection unit 2 and the area is now protected. When the main memory size is 8 MB, the start address of the extended arena in main memory is now 0x23E0000 rather than 0x2400000. The size was expanded to 128 KB.

<P>The structure passed to the callback for <code>WM_SetMPData*</code> functions has been changed. Previously, <code>destBitmap</code> was specified, but for AID of the disconnected DS system, the bit value that corresponded to the <code>restBitmap</code> field was indeterminate. This has been changed so that it is always 0. In addition, a <code>sentBitmap</code> field that stores an AID bitmap of a partner capable of sending was newly added. To determine if any DS systems did not receive the transmission because they were not connected or disconnected, compare the <code>destBitmap</code> field with the <code>sentBitmap</code> field.</P>

This was fixed. We changed the internal operation so that MP-related midstream acknowledgements will not occur before the callback of <code>WM_StartMP(Ex)</code>. This change caused the operation of the ARM7 to stop in some rare instances if a child connected and disconnected repeatedly. This problem was fixed.

<P>
In the sub 2D engine, there was a bug where VRAM extension flag of a non-existent bitmap OBJ was defined as the define value. The following definitions were eliminated.
</P>
<UL>
<LI>REG_GXS_DB_DISPCNT_EXOBJ_BM_MASK
<LI>REG_GXS_DB_DISPCNT_EXOBJ_BM_SHIFT
</UL>
<P>
Also, the <code>GXS_SetOBJVRamModeBmp</code> function was fixed so that it checks, using <code>ASSERT</code>, arguments that use this flag.
</P>


<H3><A name="note21-16" id="note21-16">Note 21-16: (GX) Distinguished transfer method depending on data size</A></H3>
<P>Fixed so that, during data transfer with GX, data is copied by the CPU without using DMA when the data size is small. Transfer by synchronous process is normally processed on the CPU for transfers under 28 bytes for 16-bit copies, and under 48 bytes for 32-bit copies.</P>


<H3><A name="note21-17" id="note21-17">Note 21-17: (GX) Fixed ASSERT bug when using GX_SetBankForBGEx</A></H3>
<P>When performing VRAM bank settings using the <code>GX_SetBankForBGEx</code> function, the warning by <code>ASSERT</code> did not appear even when loading data in an incorrect address during the DEBUG build. This bug was fixed.</P>


<H3><A name="note21-18" id="note21-18">Note 21-18: (GX) Added the GX_ResetCapture function</A></H3>
<P>
The capture enable flag set with the <code>GX_SetCapture</code> function is usually automatically reset after completion of capture. However, the <code>GX_ResetCapture</code> function was also added as a separate cancellation function that can reset. However, be aware that you cannot abort a capture that is already in progress.

<P>In the force stop process performed when hot swap of DS Game Card or Game Pak is detected, the wave send sometimes didn't stop completely during wireless communication. Also, it was sometimes unclear whether the LED was illuminated. These bugs have been fixed.</P>


<H3><A name="note21-20" id="note21-20">Note 21-20: (CARD) Eliminated the CARD_ReadRomID function</A></H3>
<P>
The <code>CARD_ReadRomID</code> function has been eliminated because there is no purpose in using it from a user application.
</P>


<H3><A name="note21-21" id="note21-21">Note 21-21: (CARD) Added a function for setting the NITRO-CARD access permission state</A></H3>
<P>Added a function for getting and setting the access permission state in order to prevent child device programs started with wireless download from carelessly accessing the NITRO-CARD. When applications not started from the NITRO-CARD access the NITRO-CARD, you must call the <code>CARD_Enable</code> function after deciding according to the rules in the Programming Guidelines.</P>


<H3><A name="note21-22" id="note21-22">Note 21-22: (TP) Fixed the behavior of the TP_GetLatestRawPointInAuto function</A></H3>
<P>In the <code>TP_GetLatestRawPointInAuto</code> function, all values sampled in the interval of the previous one frame were treated as touch OFF when they were touch ON and INVALID. It was fixed so that in this situation also the validity value is set and returned as touch ON.</P>


<H3><A name="note21-23" id="note21-23">Note 21-23: (TP) Improved the countermeasures for noise the touch panel receives from the LCD</A></H3>
<P>
When performing touch panel sampling at a specific timing, there was a combination, depending on the hardware, where a lot of noise from the LCD was picked up. For this reason, we improved the countermeasures against noise during sampling.
</P>


<H3><A name="note21-24" id="note21-24">Note 21-24: (MIC) Added an API for adjusting the sampling rate during auto-sampling</A></H3>

<H3><A name="note21-25" id="note21-25">Note 21-25: (OS) Added an interrupt check flag for application (2nd notice)</A></H3>
<P>
The interrupt check flags OS_IE_USER_FLAG0 and OS_IE_USER_FLAG1 were only available on the ARM7. These flags were added in &quot;Note 6-35: (OS) Added interrupt check flags for applications&quot; (NITRO-SDK Version 1.2 PR1). These are now also available on the ARM9.
</P>


<H3><A name="note21-26" id="note21-26">Note 21-26: (OS) Added OS_DestroyThread function</A></H3>
<P>Added <code>OS_DestroyThread()</code>, which specifies and terminates a thread. (This function was originally prepared as an internal function.)
</P>

<H3><A name="note21-27" id="note21-27">Note 21-27: (OS) Eliminated OS demo interrupt-key-1, and modified WaitIrq-2</A></H3>
<P>
&quot;Note 13-18: (PAD) Eliminated PAD_SetIrq() and PAD_ClearIrq()&quot; (NITRO SDK 2.0 PR4 release), use of key interrupts was prohibited. Therefore, interrupt-key-1 (key interrupt demo) in the OS demo has been eliminated. Furthermore, <code>WaitIrq-2</code>, which used key interrupts, was changed so that it uses timer interrupts.
</P>


<H3><A name="note21-28" id="note21-28">Note 21-28: (OS) Added OS_EnableMainExArena() and OS_DisableMainExArena()</A></H3>
<P>
Up to now, in order to use extended main memory arena, it was necessary to make OS library with <code>NITRO_MEMSIZE=8M</code> specified. However, it is now possible to declare whether or not to use extended main memory arena by specifying <code>OS_EnableMainExArena()</code> and <code>OS_DisableMainExArena()</code> before <code>OS_Init()</code> (<code>OS_InitArena()</code> when not using <code>OS_Init()</code>).

However, extended main memory arena can never be used when operating in an environment (including actual equipment) with only 4 MB of main memory installed.

<P>
For <code>MI_SendGXCommandAsyncFast()</code> and <code>MI_SendGXCommandAsync()</code>, the volatile specification was not appropriate and caused the termination wait to work improperly when the specified DMA was already in use. This has been fixed.
</P>


<H3><A name="note21-33" id="note21-33">Note 21-33: (MI) Resolved problem with multiplex DMA</A></H3>
<P>Created restrictions on source address when using DMA0 to deal with the hardware bug when there are multiple DMAs. Specifically, made it impossible to specify 0x<em>mmnnnnnn</em> (<em>mm</em> = 0x04 and 08-ff, <em>nnnnnn</em> is arbitrary) in source address of DMA0. These restrictions also apply for source address when transfer ends.</P>
<P>Also, dummy empty DMA transfer is performed after using DMA0.</P>
<P>There are no restrictions on DMA1 through DMA3.</P>


<H3><A name="note21-34" id="note21-34">Note 21-34: (PXI) Modified the PXI initialization process</A></H3>
<P>Changed order of PXI control register clear and PXI interrupt setting from &quot;interrupt setting -&gt; register clear&quot; to &quot;register clear -&gt; interrupt setting&quot;.</P>
<P>This was done because with the previous order, data remained in the PXI FIFO register when setting an interrupt, and an interrupt occurred at that point.</P>


<H3><A name="note21-35" id="note21-35">Note 21-35: (DevEnv) Added a size check option for clone boot to makerom</A></H3>

<P>When the ARM7 on a child device freezes because of a change to the halt state while performing communication, the child device's wireless hardware automatically continues to return Null and the generated error cannot be detected by the application on the parent device. To deal with this issue, the internal process was changed to cut off the connection if a child device continues to return a Null value for a certain period of time.</P>
<P>When the ARM7 on a parent device freezes because of a change to the halt state, the parent device's wireless hardware automatically continues to keep sending a beacon and the generated error cannot be detected by the application on the child device. A change was made to automatically disconnect if the no MP frames are received from the parent device for a certain period of time. The default value is set to 4 seconds on both the parent and child devices.</P>
<P>In addition to this change, the <code>mpLifeTime argument</code> was added to <code>WM_SetLifeTime()</code>.

<H3><A name="note19-01" id="note19-01">Note 19-01: (WM) Changed the return value of WM_GetAllowedChannel() when an error occurs</A></H3>
<P>In <code>WM_GetAllowedChannel()</code>, when an error occurs (<code>WM_Init()</code> was not called in advance), the return value, which was previously 0, is now 0x8000.</P>
<P>This allows you to distinguish between this error and the error that occurs when there is no available channel (return value of 0x0000).</P>

<H3><A name="note19-02" id="note19-02">Note 19-02: (WM) Changed part of the internal specifications of the WM_End library termination function</A></H3>
<P>The <code>WM_End()</code> function used to perform the library force quit process and memory release after the user callback was called. But we changed the method so that all end processes are completed before the callback is called.</P>
<P>This change is in response to requests from people who want to call the next <code>WM_Initialize()</code> function in the callback for the <code>WM_End()</code> function.</P>

<H3><A name="note19-03" id="note19-03">Note 19-03: (WM) Changed WMDisconnectCallback structure</A></H3>
<P>We added a new structure that is passed to the callback for <code>WM_Disconnect()</code> and <code>WM_DisconnectChildren()</code>. This structure is similar to the <code>WMCallback</code> structure, but has additional members, which contain an AID bitmap of the devices that requested the disconnect and an AID bitmap of the devices that were disconnected.</P>
<P>The member variables at the beginning of the newly created <code>WMDisconnectCallback</code> structure match those of previous <code>WMCallback</code> structure and the new structure can be treated as a <code>WMCallback</code> structure.</P>

<H3><A name="note19-04" id="note19-04">Note 19-04: (WM) Corrected initialization of WM_Reset()</A></H3>
<P>When <code>WM_Reset()</code> was called after MP communication was established, the automatic processing for MP communication would not be reset.</P>
<P>We corrected this bug and now the automatic processing is always reset. This may reduce the processing burden.</P>


<H3><A name="note19-05" id="note19-05">Note 19-05: (WM) Corrected processing at end of data sharing</A></H3>
<P>If MP communication occurred between <code>WM_EndDataSharing()</code> and <code>WM_EndMP()</code>, erroneous processing occurred in some cases. This bug was corrected.</P>
<P>Please note that if <code>WM_EndDataSharing()</code> is called immediately before calling <code>WM_StartDataSharing()</code>, a problem may occur.</P>

<H3><A name="note19-06" id="note19-06">Note 19-06: (WM) Changed upper limit of data size in data sharing</A></H3>
<P>When using data sharing with libraries before RC1, the maximum shared data size multiplied by the number of shared machines was 252 bytes. We expanded this value to 508 bytes. As a result, the size of the <code>WMDataSharingInfo</code> structure has increased by 1K byte. To return to the previous state, change <code>WM_DS_DATA_SIZE_508</code> in <code>wm.h</code> to <code>#undef</code>.</P>

<P>When setting <code>MBUserInfo</code>, which is an argument of <code>MB_Init()</code>, the termination of the user name was indicated by a NULL, and even when the <code>nameLength</code> variable was changed, the change was not reflected on the child screen.</P>
<P>This bug was fixed.</P>

<H3><A name="note19-08" id="note19-08">Note 19-08: (MB) Added MB_StartParentEx() and MB_EndEx()</A></H3>
<P>We added <code>MB_StartParentEx()</code>, which can be called even when the wireless library is in the idle state, and <code>MB_EndEx()</code>, which sets the wireless library to the idle state and then stops. They correspond to the standard <code>MB_StartParent()</code> and <code>MB_End()</code>. In other respects, they can be used in the same way as the standard functions.</P>

<P>If a multiboot parent running the MB library calls <code>MB_RegisterFile()</code> and <code>MB_UnregisterFile()</code> alternately to dynamically change a saved program, if the GGID of the program before the change matches the GGID of the program after the change, the change is not detected on the IPL side.</P>
<P>We have added a warning about this to the reference for <code>MB_UnregisterFile()</code>.</P>

<H3><A name="note19-10" id="note19-10">Note 19-10: (MB) Added a demo that surveys the channel signal usage</A></H3>
<P>We added a demo that surveys signal usage during MB preprocessing for multiboot. It is in <code>$NitroSDK/build/demos/mb/mbm</code>. Because <code>MBM_MeasureChannel()</code> will get the optimal channel and then turn off power to the wireless system, after obtaining the callback, you should begin multiboot processing from <code>MB_Init()</code> as usual.</P>

<H3><A name="note19-11" id="note19-11">Note 19-11: (MB) Implemented new method to set the tgid value in the multiboot demo</A></H3>
<P>In the multiboot sample demo's parent operations, we changed the tgid setting value, which is used to manage wireless connection sessions, so that when possible, it changes each time the power is turned ON. The minute and second values from the current time obtained with RTC are used as tgid values.</P>

<H3><A name="note19-12" id="note19-12">Note 19-12: (MB) Changed part of the internal specifications of the MB_End library termination function</A></H3>
<P>In the <code>MB_End()</code> function, library end processing such as memory release was performed after the user callback was called. Revised it so that all end processing is completed before the callback is called.</P>
<P>This revision is the same as <A href="#note19-05">Note 19-05</a>, and is to deal with the situation where MB re-initialization is performed in the <code>MB_End()</code> user callback. This corrected a problem where the documentation and actual operation did not match.</P>

<H3><A name="note19-15" id="note19-15">Note 19-15: (WBT) Corrected WBT library</A></H3>
<P>Two problems with the <code>WBTlibrary</code> were corrected.</P>
<UL>
<LI>When <code>WBT_GetBlockInfo()</code> was called when a block was not stored on the other machine, the <code>WBTBlockInfo</code> structure that was returned by the callback would have unpredictable values. The structure now returns with all members cleared to zero.
<LI>The <code>WBT_GetBlockInfo()</code> function had higher priority than <code>WBT_GetBlock()</code> and this would sometimes cause a deadlock. This was fixed by reducing the priority of <code>WBT_GetBlockInfo()</code>.
</UL>

<H3><A name="note19-16" id="note19-16">Note 19-16: (FS) Added the FS_RegisterOverlayToDebugger() function</A></H3>
<P>We added the function <code>FS_RegisterOverlayToDebugger()</code> to the FS library. This function is used to notify the debugger of an overlay load when you use a series of low-level functions (such as file read) to load an overlay module rather than using high-level functions, such as <code>FS_LoadOverlay()</code>.</P>
<P>If you use <code>FS_GetOverlayFileID()</code>, <code>FS_ReadFile()</code> and <code>FS_StartOverlay()</code> in combination to load an overlay, call this function before calling <code>FS_StartOverlay()</code>, so that you will be able to trace the operation in the debugger.</P>
<P>We added a demo, <code>$NitroSDK/build/demos/fs/overlay</code>, which contains an example of the function's usage.</P>

<H3><A name="note19-17" id="note19-17">Note 19-17: (OS) Changed V-count alarm processing</A></H3>
<P>We changed the routine for alarms resulting from the V-count (VAlarm). Previously, the &quot;first VAlarm in the loop resulting from an interrupt&quot; only calls a handler when the V-count was the precisely the specified value. This resulted in processing delays in the wireless library and other libraries that relied on this feature.</P>
<P>The &quot;first VAlarm in the loop resulting from an interrupt,&quot; is, as its name suggests, a VAlarm handler called by a V-count interrupt. After this handler is called, the call count of other registered alarms is checked and handlers are called if necessary.</P>
<P>This processing was changed so that the VAlarm handler called by the interrupt is called even when the V-count exceeds the specified value. The amount that the V-count can exceed this value (the delay) can be set by the programmer. (If the call is not in time, it will be performed in the next frame.)</P>
<P>One argument (<code>delay</code>) was added to the VAlarm configuration function, <code>OS_SetVAlarm()</code>, for this purpose.</P>
<P>Previously, the function call was:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>OS_SetVAlarm( alarm, vcount, handler, arg );</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Now it is:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><code>OS_SetVAlarm( alarm, vcount, <strong>delay</strong>, handler, arg );</code></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>For details see the reference for <code><A href="os/valarm/OS_SetVAlarm.html">OS_SetVAlarm()</A></code>.</P>
<P>There has always been a way to specify a delay with a periodic VAlarm, but with an interrupt-triggered VAlarm, the delay did not work. Now you can specify the precise delay for the alarm.</P>
<P><code>OS_SetVAlarm()</code> now has one more argument, but if you want to use the previous function call and not specify a delay, use the same arguments and call <code>OS_SetOneTimeVAlarm()</code> instead of <code>OS_SetVAlarm()</code>. This function will set the delay to 10. (Internally, the delay has always been treated as being 10.)</P>
<P>The maximum value for the delay is <code>OS_VALARM_DELAY_MAX</code>. If this value is specified, the specified VAlarm handler will be called no matter how much time elapses.</P>

<P>Correction of NITRO-SDK 2.0 RC1 &quot;Note 18-16: (PM) Eliminating ghost images during sleep mode&quot; caused the following problem. As a result of the fix of the ghost image problem, when the machine was woken up after being transitioned into sleep mode by <code>PM_GoSleepMode()</code>, the GX library's status changed from its pre-sleep status, and this caused the LCD to restore incorrectly in some cases. This was fixed and now the LCD will restore correctly after being in sleep mode.</P>

<P>Note: </strong> Due to the <A href="wm_changes_041006.txt">changes with WM library</a> in version 2.0 RC1, programs with 2.0 FC or older versions cannot be compiled as is. Following are some major updates. </B></P>
<P>Deleted the test mode operation functions <code>WM_StartTestMode()</code> and <code>WM_StopTestMode()</code>.</P>
<P>The specification of <code>WM_GetAllowedChannel()</code> was that even though it was a synchronous function, it did not return a valid value unless it was in IDLE state after executing <code>WM_PowerOn()</code>. However, this specification had a potential for confusing the library users, so the changes were made to return a valid value any time after it was initialized with the <code>WM_Init()</code> function.</P>
<P>Noise was added when using the sound library to play high pitched sounds during the wireless communication. This issue was improved significantly.</P>
<P>The specification was changed to disconnect the device when an unrecoverable and fatal error occurred with the wireless communication protocol due to the influence by other wireless communication devices other than Nintendo DS. The application receives the same notification as normal disconnection, so there is no need to write corresponding codes.</P>
<P>An unique setting value that is required for each Nintendo DS system during the wireless communication is kept internally in Nintendo DS. If this setting value is destroyed for some reason, the communication cannot be executed properly. Therefore, the program stops automatically if the wireless setting value is destroyed when there was an attempt for the wireless communication.</P>
<P>6) For game group ID, both u16[2] type definitions and u32 type definitions are used. It caused confusion, so they were standardized as u32 types.

Interface changes in APIs were executed for the following.</P>
<UL>
<LI><code>WMParentParam</code> structure
<LI><code>WM_SetGameInfo()</code> function
<LI><code>MB_Init()</code> function
</UL>
<P>Due to this change, sample demos that perform the wireless communication were updated.</P>
<P>The argument <code>ignoreFatalError</code> was added to <code>WM_StartMPEx()</code>. Normally, FALSE should be given.</P>
<P>The maximum value of the maximum numbers of bytes that can be sent by parent or child that is specified with <code>WMParentParam</code> increased from 508 bytes to 512 bytes. However, the 5600-microsecond limitation required for MP communication has not been changed, so the number of bytes must be set within the limits. The value of <code>MB_COMM_PARENT_SEND_MAX</code> in MB library is not changed.</P>
<P>As the distance between the parent and child increases while <code>minPollBmpMode</code> of <code>WM_StartMPEx</code> is set to TRUE, the communication was disconnected with the return value of <code>WM_GetLinkLevel</code> set to the maximum level of 3. This problem was solved. At the same time, the behavior of the radio receive strength that is taken by <code>WM_GetLinkLevel</code> was changed. The frequency of the value change became slow.</P>
<P>Both the u16[3] type definitions and u8[6] type definitions were used for MAC addresses, and it was causing confusions. This was standardized as u8[6] types. Interface changes in APIs were executed for the following.</P>
<UL>
<LI><code>WM_SetDCFData</code> function
<LI><code>WMStartParentCallback</code> structure
<LI><code>WMStartScanCallback</code> structure
<LI><code>WMPortRecvCallback</code> structure

</UL>
<P>Due to this change, sample demos that perform the wireless communication were updated.</P>
<P>For all of the wireless sample demos that use the setting value that exceeds the required time for MP communication as it is defined in the programming guidelines, made changes to use the value within the proper range.</P>

<p><ol>
<li>For multiboot parents, there was a problem that a certain parent was more difficult to be found when there are multiple parents. This problem was corrected.</p>
<li>Regarding the compatibility between the wireless library and sound library, a communication problem occurred when using the sound library for heavy load processing while the wireless library is communicating. This problem was solved by giving priority to the wireless library processes over sounds.</p>
<li>With WM library, when the data that was going to be passed to the <code>WM_Initialize</code> function was left in cache in dirty state, it affected the operation of the WM library. This problem was solved.</p>
<li>Up to the version PR6, if <code>minPollBmpMode</code> in <code>WM_StartMPEx</code> was set to TRUE with a parent and the parent communicated with only a certain child for a fixed period of time, other children were disconnected because of the timeout. Especially if the sequential communication was being used at ports with number 8 or higher and some children were forcibly disconnected, the above mentioned problem occurred easily. To solve this problem, change was made so that during the MP communication both the parent and children transmit Keep Alive frame with the number of sendable bytes set to 0, only if <code>minPollBmpMode</code> is set to TRUE.</p>
<li>Corrected the problem that the value that was smaller than the necessary size was returned because of the calculation error in <code>WM_GetMPReceiveBufferSize</code> and <code>WM_MP_SIZE_PARENT_RECEIVE_BUFFER</code>.</p>
<li>Added the "wireless communication time calculation sheet" to the reference. The time required for MP commutation is calculated from the maximum send size of the parent and child.</p>
<li>For the notification of port receiving callback to <code>WM_STATECODE_CONNECTED</code>, <code>DISCONNECTED</code>, changes were made so that aid is always the AID of the connection targets. Its own AID is assigned to <code>myAid</code>.</p>

To proceed safely, call <code>OS_Panic()</code> inside <code>OS_ResetSystem()</code> to stop. (after outputting a message, it becomes an infinite loop, except the FINALROM version).

Also, when the wireless communication is not needed (<code>WM_PowerOff</code>), shut down the wireless hardware.</p>
  <li>There was a problem with the wireless communication while the sound is being played because the wireless library DMA and the sound library DMA compete in ARM7. There are still some restrictions on the use of sounds, but the problem that the wireless communication was dissolved. This is also explained in "Note 15-16: (WM/SND) Dealt with the problem with simultaneous use of the wireless and sound features."</p>

  <li>There was a problem with the process when <code>pollBitmap</code> (Poll map) was not being sent to itself, and it was causing a problem when the target child for the communication was switched by <code>pollBitmap</code>. This problem was solved.</p>
  <li>Added restriction for starting the communication as the parent so that the <code>WM_INVALID_PARAMETER</code> error is returned when a specified value is larger than the size of the data that can be transmitted with one MP communication. Added a feature to debug output the warning when the transfer data size is larger than the recommended value, as it is explained in the programming guide line.</p>
  <li>With the child's application, when the state value, which is the argument for the callback to <code>WM_StartMP()</code>, was set to <code>WM_STATECODE_MP_IND</code>, it only passed <code>WM_ERRCODE_SUCCESS</code> as errcode. With NITRO-SDK 2.0 PR6 and later versions, <code>WM_ERRCODE_INVALID_POLLBITMAP</code> is returned when itself was not included in pollBitmap of MP.</p>
<p>This situation occurs frequently when there are more than two children in the MP communication, and it should not be treated as unrecoverable error.</p>
  <li>With the child's application, <code>WM_ERRCODE_SUCCESS</code>, <code>WM_ERRCODE_TIMEOUT</code>, and <code>WM_ERRCODE_FAILED</code> were passed as errcode when the state value, which is the argument for the callback to <code>WM_StartMP()</code>, was set to <code>WM_STATECODE_MP_IND</code>. It was corrected as shown below.</p>
    <ul><li>Made changes to return <code>WM_ERRCODE_INVALID_POLLBITMAP</code> when itself is not included in pollBitmap at the corresponding MP frame. This occurs frequently when more than 2 children are used for the MP communication, and it should not be treated as unrecoverable error.
        <li>Previously, <code>WM_ERRCODE_FAILED</code> was returned when itself was included in pollBitmap with MPACK (in other words, when the parent could not receive the reply). This was changed to return <code>WM_ERRCODE_SEND_FAILED</code>.
    </ul></p>
  <li>Previously, <code>WM_ERRCODE_SUCCESS</code>, <code>WM_ERRCODE_TIMEOUT</code>, and <code>WM_ERRCODE_FAILED</code> were used as the errcode that was passed to the callback of <code>WM_SetMPData()</code> and <code>WM_SetMPDataToPort()</code>. However, <code>WM_ERRCODE_TIMEOUT</code> and <code>WM_ERRCODE_FAILED</code> were combined into <code>WM_ERRCODE_SEND_FAILED</code>. In doing so, <code>WMPortSendCallback.destBitmap</code> now includes the bitmap of aid for the child that needs to retry after the communication failure. (the child that was disconnected during the communication is not included in destBitmap.)</p>
  <li>Changed the procedure for calling the callback every time the MP communication ends at the parent when the state value in the callback of <code>WM_StartMP()</code> was set to <code>WM_STATECODE_MPEND_IND</code>. 
Previously, the order of callbacks was:</p>
    <ol><li>Transmission complete callback (callback of <code>WM_SetMPDataToPort()</code>)
        <li><code>WM_STATECODE_MPEND_IND</code> (callback of <code>WM_StartMP()</code>)
        <li>Port receiving callback (each callback registered with <code>WM_SetPortCallback()</code>)
    </ol>
<p>However, the order was changed to:</p>
    <ol><li>Port receiving callback (each callback registered with <code>WM_SetPortCallback()</code>)
        <li>Transmission complete callback (callback of <code>WM_SetMPDataToPort()</code>)
        <li><code>WM_STATECODE_MPEND_IND</code> (callback of <code>WM_StartMP()</code>)
    </ol></p>
<p>This change was made so that data that reflects the latest receive data is transmitted immediately when the standard structure such as executing the next <code>WM_SetMPDataToPort()</code> by the callback of <code>WM_SetMPDataToPort()</code> is used for the program.</p>
  <li>Added the <code>WM_SetMPDataToPortEx()</code> function. User defined data can be added to the argument of the transmission complete callback.</p>
  <li>The maximum send size of the child processed with <code>WMParentParam</code> was set to the size that was 2 bytes smaller than the specified value. This problem was solved. <code>parentMaxSize</code> and <code>childMaxSize</code> were the parameters that specify the maximum size of user data to be transmitted. There is no need to count the size of the control data in the wireless library.</p>
  <li>To use key sharing with NITRO-SDK 2.0 PR5, it was necessary to explicitly add the value that is used for key sharing to the maximum send bytes. It was changed so that the maximum send bytes were automatically expanded by the amount of data used for key sharing by setting TRUE with <code>WMParentParam.KS_Flag</code>.</p>
  <li>The argument <code>ksFlag</code> was added to each of the function macros of <code>WM_SIZE_MP_PARENT_SEND_BUFFER</code>, <code>WM_SIZE_MP_PARENT_RECEIVE_BUFFER</code>, <code>WM_SIZE_MP_CHILD_SEND_BUFFER</code>, and <code>WM_SIZE_MP_CHILD_RECEIVE_BUFFER</code>.
To calculate the buffer size for key sharing, specify TRUE, if not FALSE, to ksFlag.</p>
  <li>Corrected the problem that the child connection information was not reset properly when <code>WM_Reset</code> was called.</p>
  <li>Added <code>WM_SetMPFrequency</code> that changes the frequency of MP communication dynamically.</p>
</ol>

<a name="note15-10"><h3>Note 15-10: (DevEnv) Added support for the compressed resident module</h3></a>
<p>Added feature for compressing the resident module that is loaded with IPL. Because of this, ROM capacity and the initial load size for the startup can be reduced.</p>

<p>In the make system of SDK, this feature is automatically enabled if a value is set to the macro variable <code>NITRO_COMPRESS</code>.  Consider the tradeoffs in the extraction time before using this feature. When the compression is enabled in SDK, the following processes are executed.</p>

<ol>
  <li>With compstatic command, executes the compression process of the region excluding the header part of the resident module execution binary.
  <li>Stores the obtained compressed module file to ROM by the makerom command, in the same way as the normal module files.
  <li>The compressed module is extracted in <code>crt0.c</code> after it was executed.
</ol>

<p>It is possible to compress the overlay module in the same way as the resident module. Extraction of the overlay module is integrated into the related APIs, so there is no need to be conscious about the processing when you access the module via API.</p>

<p>In order to implement this process, the following tool files have been changed from NITRO-SDK 2.0 PR5. When using an unique rsf file and <code>lcf.template</code> file, these files need to be changed.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>$NitroSDK/include/nitro/specfiles/ROM-TS.rsf</code>
  <li><code>$NitroSDK/include/nitro/specfiles/ARM9-TS.lcf.template</code>
</ul>

<p>This compression and extraction processes can be applied to the execution module in the ROM file that is passed to the multiboot child.</p>


<a name="note15-11"><h3>Note 15-11: (DevEnv) Startup of nitload by make run</h3></a>

<a name="note15-16"><h3>Note 15-16: (WM/SND) Dealt with the problem with simultaneous use of the wireless and sound features</h3></a>
<p>With NITRO-SDK 2.0 PR5, there was a problem that the wireless feature did not work properly when the wireless and sound features were used at the same time. This problem was solved.</p>

<p>However, because of the DMA hardware specification, there is a possibility of interrupting the sound when the playback causes a large burden on the data transfer, such as playing the waveform data with the sampling rate of 44kHz at the pitch that is 3 octaves higher.</p>

<h3><a name="note14-01">Note 14-01</a>: (WM) [Important] Corrected the wireless control library and added features</h3>
<ol>
<li>Changed the data structure that the parent broadcasts<br />
The user name and game name were deleted from the system reserved region. The developer region was also expanded from 64 bytes to the maximum of 112 bytes. The user name and game name are stored in the developer region, when needed.</li><BR /><BR />

<li>Added a feature to notify the 24-byte child information when a child connects to the parent<br />
The contents of the 24-byte child information was opened to developers so that a child can notify the parent of the application-specific information. In addition, the <CODE>WM_StartConnect()</CODE> function and the interface of the <CODE>WMStartParentCallback</CODE> structure were changed.</li><BR /><BR /><BR />

<li>Added features to control the details of multi-port (MP) communication<br />
Until SDK-PR4, it was possible to execute one MP communication per frame (one picture frame) or continuous transfer regardless of the frames. The feature that executes multiple times of MP communication per frame is now available.<br />
Along with this change, the interface of the WM_StartMP function has changed. Also, added the <CODE>WM_StartMPEx()</CODE> function to allow detailed settings.</li><BR /><BR />

<li>Extended the feature that changes the data broadcast by the parent during the communication<br />
Added feature that changes the parent attribute, such as receiving entry and accepting multiboot, during the communication.<br />
Along with this change, the interface of the <CODE>WM_SetGameInfo()</CODE> function has changed.</li><BR /><BR />

<li>Added single-function APIs as shown below

<h3><a name="note14-02">Note 14-02</a>: (MI) [Important] Dealt with hardware restrictions related to the automatic DMA</h3>

<p>Added processes to deal with hardware restrictions or generate warnings for the automatic DMAs that do not process immediately, listed below:</p>
<PRE>    V-blank startup
    H-blank startup
    Display synchronization
    Work RAM display
    Memory Card data
    Game Pak DMA
    Geometry Command FIFO
</PRE>

<p>The automatic DMAs cannot be used together. When an attempt was made to start multiple DMAs, it was stopped with <CODE>OS_Panic()</CODE>. However, H-blank startup DMA and V-blank startup DMA can be used together.</p>

<p>Also, the following corrections were made to the Geometry Command FIFO DMA.</p>
<ul>
<li>The synchronous version of <CODE>MI_SendGXCommand()</CODE> was moved to ITCM.</li>

<li>The asynchronous version of <CODE>MI_SendGXCommandAsync()</CODE> was changed so it does not use the automatic DMA of the Geometry Command to make it possible to use it with other automatic DMAs. The asynchronous transfer became possible by controlling the immediate DMA using software interrupts.</li>

<li>In the asynchronous version in SDK 2.0 PR4 or earlier, <CODE>MI_SendGXCommandAsync()</CODE>, which uses the automatic DMA, was changed to <CODE>MI_SendGXCommandAsyncFast()</CODE>.</li>
</ul>



<h3><a name="note14-03">Note 14-03</a>: (DevEnv) [Important] Included the component and library that support the hardware version</h3>

<h3><a name="note14-06">Note 14-06</a>: Changed to CodeWarrior version 0.6.1 to build the SDK</h3>

<p>NITRO SDK PR5 uses version 0.6.1 of CodeWarrior for building the SDK binary file. CodeWarrior 0.6.1 is included in the SDK.</p>



<h3><a name="note14-07">Note 14-07</a>: (DevEnv) Corrected the problem that code in the .itcm/.dtcm sections was not placed in ITCM/DTCM</h3>

<p>In the <CODE>ARM9-TS.lcf.template</CODE> file, the way the .itcm/.dtcm sections were placed was different from what was expected in <CODE>makelcf</CODE>, and the codes defined in the .itcm/.dtcm sections were not placed in the autoload section of ITCM/DTCM.</p>

<p><CODE>Makelcf</CODE> was corrected, and in case an Object/Library description did not limit the section, the section placed by this description is now limited to the basic section used by the compiler (such as text, .rodata, .data, and .sdata). It does not include sections such as .itcm/.dtcm that were newly defined in theNITRO-SDK.</p>



<h3><a name="note14-08">Note 14-08</a>: (GX) Corrected problems with the mosaic size setting</h3>

<p>When setting the mosaic size, there were problems with <CODE>G2*_SetBGMosaicSize()</CODE>, which clears the OBJ mosaic, and <CODE>G2*_SetOBJMosaicSize()</CODE>, which clears the BG mosaic.</p>

<p>These problems are fixed.</p>



<h3><a name="note14-09">Note 14-09</a>: (GX) Corrected problems with the definitions, such as <CODE>GX_InitEx()</CODE> in <CODE>gx.h</CODE></h3>

<p>In <CODE>$NitroSDK/include/nitro/gx.h</CODE>, <CODE>GX_InitEx()</CODE> and <CODE>GX_GetDefaultDMA()</CODE> were not declared as inline functions. This problem was corrected.</p>



<h3><a name="note14-10">Note 14-10</a>: (CARD) Support for FLASH device</h3>

<p>The CARD module now supports FLASH device as well as EEPROM device. With sub board and flash card, this can be used on the retail product and the debugger.</p>



<h3><a name="note14-11">Note 14-11</a>: (CARD) Corrected the problem with calling <CODE>CARD_Init()</CODE> with interrupts prohibited</h3>

<p>This problem is fixed.</p>



<h3><a name="note14-12">Note 14-12</a>: (CARD) Corrected the problem with calling <CODE>CARD_IdentifyBackup()</CODE></h3>

<p>After calling <CODE>CARD_IdentifyBackup()</CODE> and its process has completed, the callback function that was specified with the last executed CARD asynchronous function was called again.</p>

<p>This problem is fixed.</p>



<h3><a name="note14-13">Note 14-13</a>: (MI) Changed how main memory access rights are switched to avoid a DMA startup delay</h3>

<p>When executing a DMA transfer using either the Main memory display startup DMA mode or the H-Blank DMA mode, the access right priority must be &quot;ARM9.&quot; Otherwise, the display may not appear properly due to a delay in the DMA automatic startup when ARM7 tries to access the main memory. The access right priority is specified with <code>MI_SetMainMemoryPriority()</code>.</p>

<p>Changes were made so that switching access rights is done with <code>gx/UnitTours/2D_BmpBg_MainRam</code> and <code>gx/UnitTours/Window_HDMA</code>, which use these DMAs. Also, the same information was added to the related reference manuals.</p>



<h3><a name="note14-14">Note 14-14</a>:  (OS) Corrected the Tick value retrieval function</h3>

<p>If the Tick value was obtained while the compiler optimization level was at or above a certain level, an correct value could not be obtained when the timer interrupt used with the Tick value was issued at a specfic time.</p>

<P>This problem is fixed.</P>



<h3><a name="note14-15">Note 14-15</a>: (OS) Stopped the interrupt check flag automatic setting for V-Blank interrupt</h3>

<p>In NITRO-SDK 2.0 PR4, the interrupt check flag (<CODE>IrqCheckFlag</CODE>) was automatically set to ON during V-Blank. This change was cancelled in the ARM9 library, and it was returned to the previous setting.</p>

<p>Regarding the operation to turn <CODE>IrqCheckFlag</CODE> ON internally in the OS, <CODE>IrqCheckFlag</CODE> can be called multiple times without causing any problems, so there are no problems with <CODE>IrqCheckFlag</CODE> being turned on every time V-Blank is called in the application. However, it was the cause of the malfunction for the application that turns on <CODE>IrqCheckFlag</CODE> once every two frames during the V-Blank process in order to update the status at the timing of 30 frames per second.</p>

<p>This is equivalent of the <CODE>IrqCheckFlag</CODE> patch in version 2.0 PR4.</p>



<h3><a name="note14-16">Note 14-16</a>: (OS) Changed the location of DTCM in the TS environment</h3>

<p>Because of the operation in the NITRO boot menu, the A button is more likely to be pressed when starting up of a game application. It requires some caution if the application causes some actions by pressing A button.</p>

<p>For determining some of the demo button triggers (buttons that were newly pressed in that frame), the initial value was set to 0 (not being pressed). However, this was changed so that the initial value is set with the current status of the button.</p>

<h3>Note 13-01: (WM) Corrected and added functions to the wireless control library</h3></a>

<ol>
<li>The port control feature was added. This feature enables the data communication of multiple upper-level protocols by using the MP protocol.</LI>
<li>Data sharing feature was added.  A sample that executes data sharing among multiple units of NITRO is available on:<br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$NitroSDK/build/demos/wm/dataShare-1</CODE><br>
The implementation of the key sharing feature has been changed so that it was realized by using this data sharing feature internally. The operation of the "ball" sample, which was provided as demo, has not been checked, and it may not work properly.</LI>
<li>Made significant changes to the structure of the structure used for the internal control. Along this change, the buffer size that is required by the WM  library was expanded.</LI>
<li>Changes were made so that during the MP communication the callback is generated every time the MP packet transfer is completed.</LI>
<li>The single-functionality APIs shown below were added:<br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WM_SetLifeTime()<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WM_MeasureChannel()<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WM_InitWirelessCounter()<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WM_GetWirelessCounter()</CODE><br><br>

The block transfer feature and enhanced upper-level library are being developed.</LI>
</ol>


<br>

<a name="note13-02">
<h3>Note 13-02: (MB) Added the DS Download Play (multiboot) library</h3></a>

<p>The DS Download Play library was added to NITRO-SDK. This is the API that provides the DS Download Play function, which sends the game program to the NITRO that has no card. Internally, this library uses the wireless manager (WM) library.</p>

<p>The program for executing multiboot, <code>mb_child.srl</code> (changed from <code>mb_child.<b>bin</b></code> in SDK 2.0 PR5), was included in the directory shown below. This program operates the same way as the retail version of a child that has no card. Use this for the operation tests until the multiboot feature is added to IPL.</p>
<PRE>    $NitroSDK/build/demos/mb/multiboot
</pre>

<p>Demo sample for the multiboot function that was added at the same time is included in the directory shown below.</p>

<a name="note13-03">
<h3>Note 13-03: (PM) Added the PM library</h3></a>

<p>This is the API for controlling the power management IC. By using this library, it is now possible to manage the LCD and backlight power supply and to check the power remaining in the battery.</p>


<br>

<a name="note13-04">
<h3>Note 13-04: (MIC/TP) Added parallel operation of microphone sampling and the touch panel</h3></a>

<p>Changes were made so that the one time touch panel sampling can be processed during the microphone auto sampling. When the touch panel request was received during the microphone auto sampling, the touch panel data read process is executed the next time the microphone sampling ends.</p>

<p>If the touch panel sampling was not completed before the next microphone sampling time, it is assumed to that the microphone's data has dropped and the microphone sampling value will be interpolated by using the immediately preceding value.</p>

<p>A demo for this feature is included in the directory shown below:</p>
<PRE>    $NitroSDK/build/demos/spi/spiMonkey2

<a name="note13-05">
<h3>Note 13-05: (MIC) Added microphone support and preprocessing with <CODE>IS-NITRO-DEBUGGER</CODE></h3></a>

<p>With the hardware with the mass produced version of the power management IC (PMIC), the preprocessing is now required to operate the amp in the PMIC to obtain the correct microphone output value. For this, processes that operate parameters such as the PMIC amp gain value were added to the <CODE>mic-1</CODE>, <CODE>mic-2</CODE>, and <CODE>spiMonkey</CODE> demos.</p>

<p>Also with this preprocessing, a macro value SDK_TS_VERSION was introduced to be able to work with different versions of PMIC. The environment variable NITRO_TS_VERSION was added to change the macro value dynamically. The NITRO_TS_VERSION value defined when it was built is passed to SDK_TS_VERSION, which takes the values shown below.</p>

<a name="note13-14">
<h3>Note 13-14: (DevEnd) Corrected the problem when expanding the <CODE>makelcf / makerom</CODE> variables; added support for the variable definition files</h3></a>

<p>With <CODE>makelcf / makerom</CODE>, in some cases when setting a string that exceeds 1000 characters for the variable that can be specified with the &ndash;D option, and then expanding it in the template file, an error occurred and stopped the process. This problem is fixed.</p>

<p>Also, the process of passing variables by using command lines will be restricted by the maximum length of the command line set with each command line process. To prevent this problem, the variable definition can be specified from the external file. Because of this, by giving the file with the description of <CODE>[variable name = value]</CODE> to <CODE>makelcf / makerom</CODE> with the &ndash;M option, the variable definition can be done without having to worry about the restriction on the command length of the command lines.</p>

<a name="note13-15">
<h3>Note 13-15: (DevEnd) Output the autoload module information to the overlay name file</h3></a>

<p>The correction was made so that the additional information used by the debugger for tracking the autoloaded codes is output to the overlay name file. To be more precise, the change was made in the definition part of the overlay name file for the <code>*.lcf.template</CODE> file in</p>
<pre>    $NitroSDK/include/nitro/specfiles

However, the key interrupt can be used for returning from the sleep mode. In that case, specify the condition with <CODE>PM_GoSleepMode()</CODE>.</p>


<br>

<a name="note13-19">
<h3>Note 13-19: (MI) Added DMA busy wait after synchronous DMA</h3></a>

<p>For synchronous DMA, the process was added after DMA to make it wait while the DMA is busy.</p>

<p>When these synchronous DMA APIs are placed on the TCM, ARM9 did not wait for the completion and is returned from API even with starting up the DMA. This was corrected so that it always waits for the completion with the synchronous DMA, regardless of the transfer location. If it is not necessary to explicitly execute the process to wait for the DMA completion, use the asynchronous DMA API.</p>

<p>The following instructions have been changed:</p>
<pre>    MI_DmaCopy16/32
    MI_DmaFill16/32

<p>Reviewed the memory map and expanded the MainRAM region that can be allocated to ARM9 by default.</p>

<p>More specifically, DTCM was placed in the region that starts at <code>0x2380000</code>, but now starts at <code>0x27C0000</code>. Along with this change, the MainRAM region that is allocated to ARM9 was changed from <code>0x2000000&mdash;0x237FFFF</code> to <code>0x2000000&mdash;0x23BFFFF</code> (increased by 256KB).

<p">Note: The bold paragraphs in Note 9-01 were added on 2004/07/26.</p>

<p><strong>To support the IS-NITRO-DEBUGGER and Nintendo DS software developer's board NITRO-TS, the default target changed from TEG to TS. (From now on, IS-NITRO-DEBUGGER and NITRO-TS refer to the same thing, unless otherwise noted.)</strong></p>

<p>The TS module is created by not defining NITRO_PLATFORM for the environment variable or the macro variable of the make command, or by setting the value to &quot;TS&quot;. Here is an example.</p>
<PRE>    % make NITRO_PLATFORM=TS
</PRE>

<p>Normally, the directory ARM9-TS or ARM9-TS.thumb is created in the subdirectories bin, lib or obj within the directory that executed make. Each module is generated in this directory.</p>

<p>Also, in order to compile with the existing TEG target version, you must explicitly specify</p>
<PRE>    % make NITRO_PLATFORM=TEG
</PRE>

<p><strong>Support for the TEG target version will continue until at least the end of 2004).</strong></p>


<br>

<h3><a name="note09-02">Note 9-02</a>: (DevEnv) Changed the file extension of the ROM binary files</h3>

<p>Corrected makerom so it matches the specification of the manufactured ROM image. To be consistent with the inspection process during production, the ROM binary file name extension was changed from .bin to .srl.</p>

<p>However, in the makefile description, the target variable name of the ROM image is left as <code>TARGET_BIN</code>.</p>


<br>

<h3><a name="note09-03">Note 9-03</a>: (DevEnv) Changed the overlay method</h3>

<p>The link methods for overlays were changed.</p>
<UL>
<LI>Changed the description of the Link spec file (LSF). Because the existing LSF files usually cannot be used without modifications, you may have created separate LSF files. If so, you may need to change these files. (For more information, refer to the makelcf reference.)</LI>

<LI>Now you can generate response files with makelcf to pass the overlay group information to the linker.</LI>
</UL>


<br>

<h3><a name="note09-04">Note 9-04</a>: (DevEnv) Changed the LCF file description</h3>

<p>An asterisk (<code>*</code>) is no longer used to specify a file with the LCF file.</p>

<p>In the LCF file, all libraries are enumerated, but the positive sign (<code>+</code>) cannot be used for the library name. Because of this restriction, the name of Metrowerks C++ Runtime Library is changed from <code>MSL_C++_NITRO_Ai_LE_strb.a</code> to <code>MSL_CXX_NITRO_Ai_LE_strb.a</code> to make a copy, and the copy is referenced.</p>


<br>

<h3><a name="note09-05">Note 9-05</a>: (DevEnv) Changed the make rule</h3>

<p>In the sample demo in the following directory, the source files are compiled in multiple subdirectories, and are linked by the parent directory.</p>
<PRE>    $NitroSDK/build/demos/tips/MultiLink
</PRE>


<br>

<h3><a name="note09-06">Note 9-06</a>: (DevEnv) Corrected the generation rule of the nef and srl files</h3>

<p>Made it possible to add dependent files to the nef and bin files by specifying <code>LDEPENDS_NEF</code> and <code>LDEPENDS_BIN</code>.</p>


<br>

<h3><a name="note09-07">Note 9-07</a>: (DevEnv) Added the compile switch <code>NITRO_CODEGEN_ALL</code></h3>

<p>Added the compile switch <code>NITRO_CODEGEN_ALL</code>. Use this switch to create libraries for both ARM and THUMB versions.</p>
<PRE>    % make NITRO_CODEGEN=ARM
    % make NITRO_CODEGEN=THUMB
</PRE>
<p>The switch results in the compilation executing twice. (The compilation is executed in the order specified with <code>NITRO_CODEGEN</code>.)</p>


<br>

<h3><a name="note09-08">Note 9-08</a>: (SND) Updated the sound library</h3>

<p>The sound library distributed with the NITRO-SDK became the 2004/06/22 version.</p>


<br>

<h3><a name="note09-09">Note 9-09</a>: (FS) Corrected an error in <code>FS_RegisterArchiveName()</code></h3>

<p>Due to the internal processing of the FS_RegisterArchiveName() function, an inconsistency problem occurred when the registered archive was released. This problem is fixed.</p>


<br>

<h3><a name="note09-10">Note 9-10</a>: (FS) Corrected the improper display of a string while debugging in the async demo thread</h3>

<p>Sometimes the wrong string was displayed when an interrupt occurred during debugging of the thread with the async demo. This problem is fixed.</p>


<br>

<h3><a name="note09-11">Note 9-11</a>: (FS) Corrected the problem of returning control prematurely while <code>FS_WaitAsync</code> is still running</h3>

<p>If the <code>OS_WakeupThreadDirect()</code> function is called while a thread is set to wait for an FS asynchronous function (using the <code>FS_WaitAsync</code> function), control is returned even though the process is not complete. This problem is fixed.</p>


<br>

<h3><a name="note09-12">Note 9-12</a>: (GX) Corrected <code>GX_SetBankForTex()</code>, <code>GX_LoadTexEx()</code>, and <code>GX_LoadTex()</code></h3>

<p>The three functions that process the noncontiguous VRAM banks had problems with the data transfer, but they were fixed.</p>


<br>

<h3><a name="note09-13">Note 9-13</a>: (GX) Changed the clear color alpha default from 0 to 31 in the GX demo</h3>

<p>In the DEMOLib of the GX demo, the default value of the clear color alpha value was changed from 0 to 31.</p>


<br>

<h3><a name="note09-14">Note 9-14</a>: (FX) Added <code>FX_AtanIdx()</code> and <code>FX_Atan2Idx()</code></h3>

<p>Added the <code>FX_AtanIdx()</code> and <code>FX_Atan2Idx()</code> functions, which return the arctangent within the range of the u16 type. Until now, only <code>FX_Atan()</code> and <code>FX_Atan2()</code>, which return the arctangent in units of radian, were available.</p>


<br>

<h3><a name="note09-15">Note 9-15</a>: (FX) Added a matrix calculation API that does not send the value to the geometry engine</h3>

<p>Added the following functions as the API that performs only the calculation without setting the data to the geometry engine.</p>
<PRE>    MTX_FrustumW()
    MTX_PerspectiveW()
    MTX_OrthoW()
    MTX_LookAt()
</PRE>
<p>With these functions, you can obtain the same matrix using <code>G3_FrustumW()</code>, <code>G3_PerspectiveW()</code>, <code>G3_OrthoW()</code>, <code>G3_LookAt()</code>.</p>

<!--NOT SURE WHAT THIS LAST SENTENCE MEANS 9/10/04-->


<br>

<h3><a name="note09-16">Note 9-16</a>: (OS) Corrected the arena setting when <code>NITRO_MEMSIZE</code> is set to 8M</h3>

<p>When a file that was compiled with <code>NITRO_MEMSIZE</code> set to 8M during make is executed on a development device with 8MB of main memory, the extended main memory arena is now set properly. Previously, the protection region was not set correctly and had to be set by the application.</p>


<br>

<h3><a name="note09-17">Note 9-17</a>: (OS) Improved thread safety using functions related to memory allocation, such as alloc and free</h3>

<p>Improved thread safety by prohibiting interrupts in a critical section using memory allocation functions, such as <code>OS_Alloc*()</code> and <code>OS_Free*()</code>.</p>


<br>

<h3><a name="note09-18">Note 9-18</a>: (OS) Added <code>OS_JoinThread()</code> and <code>OS_IsThreadTerminated()</code></h3>

<p>Added <code>OS_JoinThread()</code>, which combines threads and waits for the specified thread to be terminated, and <code>OS_IsThreadTerminated()</code>, which checks whether the thread has terminated.</p>


<br>

<h3><a name="note09-19">Note 9-19</a>: (OS) Corrected the DMA address check ASSERT</h3>

<p>The debug build uses ASSERT to check if it overlaps the TCM address, but there was an error with the boundary condition. This problem was fixed.</p>


<br>

<h3><a name="note09-20">Note 9-20</a>: (OS) Changed the operation of <code>OS_SetProtectionRegion()</code></h3>

<p><code>OS_SetProtectionRegion()</code> was changed to set and enable the protection region. Before, it was not enabled.</p>


<br>

<h3><a name="note09-21">Note 9-21</a>: (OS) Changed the function cost measurement profiler</h3>

<p>Changed the clock information in the profiler from u16 to u32 to enable the measurement of functions that require more time. Also fixed an error in the calculation of the required compilation time.</p>


<br>

<h3><a name="note09-22">Note 9-22</a>: (MI) Added functions to obtain the compression type and size of expanded data</h3>

<p>Created functions to obtain the compression type and the size of the expanded data in memory. <code>MI_GetCompressionType()</code> obtains the compression type, and <code>MI_GetUncompressedSize()</code> obtains the size of the expanded data.</p>


<br>

<h3><a name="note09-23">Note 9-23</a>: (MI) Changed the names of the <code>MI_GetCartridgeRomCycle*</code> functions</h3>

<p>Standardized the names of the <code>MI_GetCartridgeRomCycle*</code> functions as 1st and 2nd. In addition, the names of the enumeration types <code>MICartridgeRomCycle1</code> and <code>MICartridgeRomCycle2</code> were changed to <code>MICartridgeRomCycle1<b>st</b></code> and <code>MICartridgeRomCycle2<b>nd</b></code>.</p>


<br>

<h3><a name="note09-24">Note 9-24</a>: (MI) Corrected ASSERT of <code>MI_CpuCopyFast()</code></h3>

<p>At debug time, build with <code>MI_CpuCopyFast()</code>, ASSERT was required to be a multiple of 32 bytes. It was changed to a multiple of 4 bytes.</p>


<br>

<h3><a name="note09-25">Note 9-25</a>: (MI) Changed the DMA parameter setting and stop processes</h3>

<p>Prohibited interrupts with the DMA parameter setting process (internal function <code>MIi_DmaParams*()</code>) and stop process (<code>MI_StopDma()</code>).</p>


<br>

<h3><a name="note09-26">Note 9-26</a>: (CP) Changed how the Divider sets the divisor</h3>

<p>When a 32-bit divisor is set in the Divider, zeros are entered into the upper 32 bits of the Divider's divisor register. By doing so, even if using a division mode with a 32-bit divisor, the Divide-by-0 error flag is enabled only if all 64 bits of the divisor register are zeros.</p>


<br>

<h3><a name="note09-27">Note 9-27</a>: (MIC) Extended the sampling types</h3>

<p>With the functions that perform sampling via microphones, the available sampling types were expanded, and you can now specify the output in signed data format.</p>


<br>

<h3><a name="note09-28">Note 9-28</a>: (PRC) Added the pattern recognition API (test release)</h3>

<p>Test released the PRC library, which permits pattern recognition of data drawn on the touch panel.</p>
<PRE>    $NitroSDK/build/demos/prc
</PRE>
<p>Here is the demo.</p>

<p>For more information, see:</p>
<PRE>    $NitroSDK/docs/TechnicalNotes/PatternRecognition.doc
</PRE>


<br>

<h3><a name="note09-29">Note 9-29</a>: (TP) Changed the precision of the data obtained from the touch panel</h3>

<p>The precision of the data obtained from the touch panel was changed from 12 bit to 9 bit. The lower 3 bits are masked on the ARM7. This change anticipates a compatibility issue that may occur in the future.</p>

<br><br>

<UL>
<li>The wireless library is under development.</li>
<li>The CARD library is under development.</li>
<li>When the system stack region is set to be the entire DTCM range of the ARM9, the DTCM arena region does not exit. Call the function that are related to the DTCM arena, the debug build of the library will stop at ASSERT. (When specifying the size of the system stack region by LSF file, it operates normally. If necessary, avoid a problem in this manner. If it is not the DEBUG build, it does not stop at ASSERT and does not return a normal value.) Due to this problem, the DEBUG build in the arena-1 of OS demo stops at ASSERT.</li>

<h3><a name="note07-02">Note 7-02: (MIC) Added the microphone API</a></h3>

<p>Added an API to operate a microphone device and demos that use the API. Also added the <code>spiMonkey</code> demo that uses the MIC, Touch Panel, and Sound libraries simultaneously.</p>



<h3><a name="note07-03">Note 7-03: (TP) Changed the maximum sampling rate</a></h3>

<p>Changed the maximum sampling rate that can be specified with auto sampling to 4 times/frame. It is expected that higher sampling rates cannot be guaranteed with the anticipated cost reduction in hardware.</p>



<h3><a name="note07-04">Note 7-04: (TP) Corrected the problem of an interrupt being generated immediately after transmitting a touch panel command</a></h3>

<p>When an interrupt was generated directly after transmitting a touch panel control command to ARM7, a bug prevented returning from waiting for a reply from ARM7. This problem is fixed.</p>



<h3><a name="note07-05">Note 7-05: (TP) Changed the auto sampling interface</a></h3>

<p>Added an argument in <code>RequestAutoSamplingStart()</code> to specify the buffer size. In doing so, a buffer size larger than the sampling rate can be specified and overwriting with new data can be supported.</p>



<h3><a name="note07-06">Note 7-06: (TP) Changed the <code>TP_SetCallback()</code> argument format</a></h3>

<p>Because <code>TP_SetCallback()</code> arguments were pointers to function pointers, it was changed so that function pointers could be passed directly as arguments.</p>



<h3><a name="note07-07">Note 7-07</a>: (FS) Corrected a problem in the size display after loading all in the <code>async</code> demo</h3>

<p>The total size (when loading all threads in the <code>async</code> demo) is displayed as <code>total **** byte.</code> However, an error in the size calculation resulted in an incorrect number. This problem is fixed.</p>



<h3><a name="note07-08">Note 7-08</a>: (FS) Corrected a problem that prevented the overlay data cache from updating</h3>

<p>Corrected the problem that prevented the data cache update process from being carried out for each of the functions that operate the overlay module.</p>



<h3><a name="note07-09">Note 7-09</a>: (FS) Corrected a problem in the <code>FS_SetDefaultDMA()</code> function</h3>

<p>A problem caused a file to be loaded incorrectly if DMA settings were changed with <code>FS_SetDefaultDMA()</code> when
executing in an environment that used a NITRO-CARD. This problem is fixed.</p>



<h3><a name="note07-10">Note 7-10: (OS) Changed the IRQ handler specifications</a></h3>

<p>When the logical product of IE and IF was 0 at the beginning of an IRQ handler, it would exit without doing anything. This was caused by an infinite loop when an interrupt was generated during IE configuration. This problem is fixed.</p>



<h3><a name="note07-11">Note 7-11: (OS) Changed the default for the maximum thread count</a></h3>

<p>Changed the maximum thread count that can be created with the thread system from 8 to 16.</p>

<p>Added the <code>OS_GetNumberOfThread()</code> function to get the number of threads currently created.</p>



<h3><a name="note07-13">Note 7-13: (OS) Changed the arena configuration</a></h3>

<p>A fixed value had been used when configuring the arena range for ARM7. However, this has been changed to configure an arena for the ARM7 shared WRAM and an arena for the ARM7-dedicated WRAM to take into account the size of the free region after storing the ARM7 program in Shared WRAM and ARM7-dedicated WRAM.</p>

<p>In addition, the two arenas are configured with ARM7 and the
remaining arenas are configured with ARM9 due to reception of defined values from the lcf file when configuring arenas with <code>OS_InitArena()</code>.</p>



<h3><a name="note07-14">Note 7-14: (OS) Changed the protection region functions</a></h3>

<p>In a previous version, <code>OS_SetProtectionRegion()</code>
was renamed <code>OS_SetProtectionReginParam()</code>,
and a new function that more directly configured the address and size was named <code>OS_SetProtectionRegion()</code>.</p>

<p><code>OS_GetProtectionRegion()</code> was divided by function into <code>OS_GetProtectionRegionParam()</code>, <code>OS_GetProtectionRegionAddress()</code>, and <code>OS_GetProtectionRegionSize()</code>.</p>



<h3><a name="note07-15">Note 7-15: (OS) Removed the Profile features from the OS library</a></h3>

<p>The Profile features were separated from the OS library and made into an independent library. In doing so, it is unnecessary to recompile the OS library when Profile features are used.</p>

<p>The necessary libraries can be linked by specifying </p>
<pre>    NITRO_PROFILE_TYPE=CALLTRACE
</PRE>
<p>when enabling the call trace function and by specifying</p>
<pre>    NITRO_PROFILE_TYPE=FUNCTIONCOST

size.</p>



<h3><a name="note07-18">Note 7-18: (OS) Changed how debug functions, such as <code>OS_Printf()</code>, are handled in the FINALROM build</a></h3>

<p>Changed the way display functions such as <code>OS_Printf()</code> are handled in the FINALROM build. Previously, <code>OS_Printf()</code> was called and became the return function without doing anything, but it is no longer called. In addition, <code>OS_Panic()</code> stops without displaying anything.</p>



<h3><a name="note07-19">Note 7-19: (OS) Changed TCM function names</a></h3>

<p>The following TCM function names have been changed to match the name specifications for other functions. The left is the function name before the change; the right is the new function name.</p>

<PRE>    OS_SetParamITCM() &rarr; OS_SetITCMParam()
    OS_SetParamDTCM() &rarr; OS_SetDTCMParam()

<h3><a name="note07-20">Note 7-20: (OS) Changed the OS demo structure</a></h3>

<p>In addition to eliminating the need to recompile the OS library by dividing the profile related features into a separate library, compilation of callTrace-1, callTrace-2, exceptionDisplay-3, functionCost-1, functionCost-2, and functionCost-3 that had not been previously included in the OS demo <code>Makefile</code> are now included.</p>



<h3><a name="note07-21">Note 7-21: (GX) Corrected the GX demo</a></h3>

<p>In the <code>AntiAlias</code> demo, <code>antialiasing</code> was not applied because <code>ClearColor</code>
was not set and blending did not occur with the background color. This problem is fixed.</p>

<p>In the <code>2D_Oam_5</code> and <code>Sub_Oam_5 demos</code>, problems in operation with the FINALROM build occurred because the data cache was not flushed. This problem is fixed.</p>



<h3><a name="note07-22">Note 7-22: (GX) Eliminated restrictions on demos due to an <code>Ensata</code> upgrade</a></h3>

<p>Due to an <code>Ensata</code> upgrade, the operating limitations on <code>AntiAlias</code>, <code>PosVecTest</code>, and <code>CurrentMtx</code>, which could only be used while <code>Ensata</code> was operating, were lifted.</p>



<h3><a name="note07-23">Note 7-23: (GX) Changed the extended palette VRAM configuration name</a></h3>

<p>Extended palette VRAM configuration names defined with</p>

<p>have been standardized to notation that includes the slot number. The previous names remain as aliases, although this is not mentioned in the manual.</p>



<h3><a name="note07-24">Note 7-24: (GX) Added support for multiple calls of <code>GX_Init</code><a></h3>

<p>When <code>GX_Init()</code> was called multiple times, it would stop because the V-Alarm structure held in static internally would initialize each time. This has been changed so that the V-Alarm structure is initialized only once even if <code>GX_Init</code> is called multiple times.</p>



<h3><a name="note07-25">Note 7-25: (GX) Added <code>GX_GetObj</code></a></h3>

<h3><a name="note07-28">Note 7-28: (DevEnv) Added an explanation of <code>makerom</code> and <code>makelcf</code></a></h3>

<p>Added a Tool item to the reference manual that includes an explanation of <code>makerom</code> and <code>makelcf.</p>



<h3><a name="note07-29">Note 7-29: (DevEnv) Added a tool to rewrite data maintained in the main unit NVRAM</a></h3>

<p>A simple tool was included to rewrite information configured with the Boot menu. Use it as a calibration configuration tool for the touch panel. The execution file is:</p>
<PRE>    $NitroSDK/bin/ARM9-TEG/Release/BootMenu.bin
</pre>

<p>Executing this on TEG causes the basic menu to start up. Because configuration items other than the touch panel may differ from the final product, think of them as reference material at this time.</p>



<h3><a name="note07-30">Note 7-30: (DevEnv) Added the &quot;&ndash;g&quot; option during the build of the FINALROM version</a></h3>

<p>Changed so that the &quot;&ndash;g&quot; option can be used to compile and link when building the FINALROM version in the build environment created with the SDK-supplied CodeWarrior make.</p>

<p>The &quot;&ndash;g&quot; option in CodeWarrior adds only debug information to the NEF file; the ROM image binary is the same.</p>

<p>In addition, the NITRO_NO_OPT_G switch is available to compile and link without the &quot;&ndash;g&quot; option.</p>

<p>Use the following to remove the &quot;&ndash;g&quot; option to build.</p>
<pre>    make NITRO_NO_OPT_G=1

<h3><a name="note07-31">Note 7-31: (DevEnv) Corrected a bug that output faulty error message with <code>makerom</code></a></h3>

<p>A bug caused the error message, <code>Wrong format list file</code> to be displayed even when no error had occurred and also stopped the execution of <code>makerom</code> when <code>makerom</code> was
executed in certain environments. This bug is fixed.</p>

<h2><a name="sdk_1_02_pr1">NITRO-SDK
Version 1.2 PR1</a></h2>

<p align=right>(2004/05/24)</p>



<h3><a
name="note6-01">Note 6-01</a>: (DevEnv) Added support for CodeWarrior NITRO V0.5</h3>

<p>Added support for CodeWarrior NITRO V0.5. Added support for the change in library file names and the change in LCF files.</p>



<h3><a name="note6-02">Note 6-02</a>: (DevEnv) Changed the ROM binary creation tool from <code>elftobin</code> to <code>makerom</code></h3>

<p>Changed the ROM binary creation tool from <code>elftobin</code>
to <code>makerom</code>. This allows the file system and overlay to be supported.</p>



<h3><a name="note6-03">Note 6-03</a>: (DevEnv) Added lcf <code>ALIGN(32)</code></h3>

<p>The lcf-related files were correct sot that 32-byte alignment might be maintained for the beginning and end of the overlay segments to prevent problems related to the cache line for the overlay.</p>



<h3><a name="note6-04">Note 6-04</a>: (DevEnv) Added support for addition procedures for files dependent on execution binary generation rules</h3>

<p>Added <code>$(LDEPENDS_NEF)</code> and <code>$(LDEPENDS_BIN)</code> to the files dependent on .nef and .bin generation rules, respectively. The specifics are shown below.</p>
<pre>$NitroSDK/build/buildtools/modulerule.cctype.CW:

    $(BINDIR)/%.nef: $(OBJS) $(LCFILE) $(MAKEFILE) $(LDEPENDS_NEF)

$NitroSDK/build/buildtools/modulerule:

    $(BINDIR)/%.bin: $(BINDIR)/%.nef $(MAKEROM_ARM7) $(ROM_SPEC) $(LDEPENDS_BIN)
</pre>



<h3><a name="note6-05">Note 6-05</a>: (DevEnv) Added support for header include from compilers other than CodeWarrior</h3>

<p>There are cases when you want to include the <code>NitroSDK</code> header files when C-compiling with a program other than CodeWarrior when creating NITRO-related tools on Windows. But, the processing system for Visual C++ generated an error when <code>nitro.h</code> was included because variable argument macros are not supported.
<code>$NitroSDK/include/nitro_win32.h</code> is available to cope with this situation.</p>

<p>By defining the two define values shown below in <code>nitro_win32.h</code>, it is possible to include header files such as <code>gx.h</code>, <code>memorymap.h</code>, and <code>type.h</code>.</p>
<pre>    #define SDK_FROM_TOOL
    #define SDK_HAS_NO_LONG_LONG_INT_
</pre>

<p>However, the #define of <code>SDK_HAS_NO_LONG_LONG_INT_</code> is specified as &quot;to replace 64-bit integers from being long long int to <code>_int64</code>,&quot; so this definition is unnecessary in environments where the long long int definition, such as gcc, is enabled.</p>



<h3><a name="note6-06">Note 6-06</a>: (DevEnv) Terminated the IDE demo sample distribution</h3>

<p>It was decided that the distribution of the IDE demo sample program for using CodeWarrior would be terminated. Since a NITRO stationary file is already available in CodeWarrior for NITRO, it was decided that the IDE sample was no longer necessary.</p>



<h3><a name="note6-07">Note 6-07</a>: (ARM7) Added the ferret integrated component</h3>

<p>Added the ferret integrated component to process various devices. If not specified otherwise, this component connects by default.</p>

<p>The component path is located under </p>
<PRE>    NitroSDK/components/ferret/ARM7-TEG/(Target)
</PRE>
<p>(For the Thumb component, the <code>ARM7-TEG</code> portion becomes <code>ARM7-TEG.thumb</code>.)</p>



<h3><a name="note6-08">Note 6-08</a>: (FS) Added the file system and overlay</h3>

<p>Added a library to use the ROM file system in applications created with <code>makerom</code>. Directory list/search, synchronous/asynchronous file read, overlays, etc. are possible.</p>

<p>The FS library supports processes that read access the NITRO-CARD, the NITRO standard software supply medium. The FS library internally switches between using the Game Pak image or NITRO-CARD image as the file system according to the TEG board device connection.</p>

<p>In connection with this, <code>SVC_ReadCard()</code> was deleted.</p>



<h3><a name="note6-09">Note 6-09</a>: (TP) Added touch panel functions</h3>

<p>The touch panel control related APIs are supported.</p>

<p>Be aware that the TP library and API that were distributed in a separate package have changed in connection with the process assignment change for ARM7 and ARM9. In addition, perform the touch panel calibration process again because of the change in the touch panel calibration parameters that occurred in connection with these changes.</p>

<p>The new touch panel calibration binary is
<code>NitroSDK/bin/ARM9-TEG/Release/BootMenu.bin</code>. After starting the binary, select TOUCH PANEL from the screen menu and perform the calibration.</p>



<h3><a name="note6-10">Note 6-10</a>: (CP) Added Divider and Square Root Unit interrupts and multi-threads</h3>

<p>To safely use the Divider and Square Root Unit interrupt processes in callbacks, APIs (<code>CP_SaveContext</code> and <code>CP_RestoreContext</code>) were prepared to store and return the current status of the Divider and Square Root Unit.</p>

<p>In addition, the Divider and Square Root Unit now support multi-threads.</p>



<h3><a name="note6-11">Note 6-11</a>: (GX) Added APIs for MtxFx22</h3>

<p>APIs for operating the 2x2 matrix MtxFx22-type variable 2x2 are available.</p>
<pre>    MTX_Identity22()
    MTX_Concat22()
    MTX_Inverse22()
    MTX_Transpose22()
    MTX_Rot22()
    MTX_Scale22()
</pre>



<h3><a name="note6-12">Note 6-12</a>: (GX) Improved poor operation of command FIFO in the TEG board</h3>

<p>Due to a hardware bug in the command FIFO overflow processing on the TEG board, <code>GX_LoadMtx44</code> and other functions did not process correctly. This was fixed in the library. This hardware bug will be corrected in the production model.</p>



<h3><a name="note6-13">Note 6-13</a>: (GX) Added <code>GX_VRAM_ARM7_128_C</code> to <code>GX_SetBankForARM7()</code></h3>

<p><code>GX_VRAM_ARM7_128_C</code> was added as an argument supported by <code>GX_SetBankForARM7()</code>.</p>



<h3><a name="note6-14">Note 6-14</a>: (GX) Corrected problem when specifying <code>GX_VRAM_BGEXTPLTT_01_F</code> to the BG extended palette</h3>

<p>Corrected the problem that caused configuration to be incorrect when <code>GX_VRAM_BGEXTPLTT_01_F</code> was set in the API <code>GX_SetBankForBGExtPltt</code>.</p>



<h3><a name="note6-15">Note 6-15</a>: (GX) Added a demo for procedure to synchronize to the <code>Swapbuffer</code> process on the geometry engine</h3>

<p>Added the demo below as a method using a polygon counter to determine whether the 3D engine calculation experienced process drop-out.</p>

<pre>    $NitroSDK/build/demos/tips/SwapCrossOver
</pre>

<p>When a discrepancy exists with the 2D screen due to a process drop-out on the 3D screen calculation, consider using this method for synchronization that uses a polygon counter.</p>



<h3><a name="note6-16">Note 6-16</a>: (GX) Added transparent conversion matrix APIs to adjust <code>scaleW</code></h3>

<p>Created the following transparent conversion APIs to set <code>scaleW</code> to a desired value.</p>

<pre>    G3_FrustumW()
    G3_PerspectiveW()
    G3_OrthoW()
</pre>

<p>In addition, <code>MTX_Frustum()</code>, <code>MTX_Perspective()</code>, and <code>MTX_Ortho()</code> are also separately available to create matrices without transmitting to the geometry engine.</p>



<h3><a name="note6-17">Note 6-17</a>: (GX) Changed the command FIFO reset process using the <code>GX_Init</code> function</h3>

<p>The implementation of the command FIFO reset process was changed. <code>G3_End()</code> is issued after 128 NOP units are sent as an internal process.</p>



<h3><a name="note6-18">Note 6-18</a>: (GX) Corrected a bug in fog mode control</h3>

<p>A bug in <code>G3X_SetFog</code> prevented <code>fogMode</code> from returning to 0 from 1. This is fixed.</p>



<h3><a name="note6-19">Note 6-19</a>: (OS) Changed the thread system handling</h3>

<p>In consideration of the controlling the various systems that may be
connected in the future, the initialization of the thread system was changed to occur by default. <code>OS_InitThread()</code> is called with <code>OS_Init()</code>.</p>

<p>If creating a library that does not use the thread system, compile after defining <code>NITRO_NO_THREAD</code>.</p>



<h3><a name="note6-20">Note 6-20</a>: (OS) Added <code>OS_SPrintf()</code></h3>

<p>With a smaller code load than the standard <code>springf()</code> function, the <code>OS_SPrintf()</code> format string function and its system were added by partially eliminating output support, such as for floating point decimal values. This function is primarily used on ARM7 for string processing.</p>



<h3><a name="note6-21">Note 6-21</a>: (OS) Added TEG board memory byte access measures</h3>

<p><code>MI_ReadByte()</code> and <code>MI_WriteByte()</code> were
prepared for memory byte access in consideration of the convenience of program creation on the TEG version. These will be converted to simple byte access instructions on the production version library.</p>



<h3><a name="note6-22">Note 6-22</a>: (OS) Added <code>OS_WaitIrq()</code>, <code>OS_WaitAnyIrq()</code>, and <code>OS_WaitInterrupt()</code></h3>

<p>Added the <code>OS_WaitIrq()</code> function that waits for a specified IRQ and the <code>OS_WaitAnyIrq()</code> and <code>OS_WaitInterrupt()</code>  functions. <code>OS_WaitIrq()</code> and <code>OS_WaitAnyIrq()</code> give processing over to other threads while waiting for an IRQ.</p>

<p><code>OS_WaitInterrupt()</code> uses <code>OS_Halt()</code> to wait, so thread movement does not occur. This has been prepared to operate the same as <code>SVC_WaitIntr()</code>.</p>



<h3><a name="note6-23">Note 6-23</a>: (OS) Added <code>ATTRIBUTE_ALIGN()</code></h3>

<p>Added the <code>ATTRIBUTE_ALIGN()</code> macro to specify arrangement alignment when defining variables. The macro name
follows the NINTENDO GAMECUBE SDK definitions.</p>



<h3><a name="note6-24">Note 6-24: (OS) Extended the IDLE thread stack</a></h3>

<p>The size of the low priority idle thread stack created when the Thread system is started is set to 128 bytes on ARM9 and 64 bytes on ARM7 for SVC.</p>



<h3><a
name="note6-25">Note 6-25</a>: (OS) Added <code>OS_GetLockID()</code> and <code>OS_ReleaseLockID()</code></h3>

<p>Added <code>OS_GetLockID()</code> and <code>OS_ReleaseLockID()</code> as a structure to manage lock IDs used by OS.</p>



<h3><a name="note6-26">Note 6-26</a>: (OS) Added <code>OS_SetSwitchThreadCallback()</code></h3>

<p>Added a callback feature when switching threads. The callback is registered with <code>OS_SetSwitchThreadCallback()</code>.</p>



<h3><a name="note6-27">Note 6-27</a>: (OS) Released <code>Mutex</code>
with <code>OS_ExitThread()</code></h3>

<p>When a thread is ended with <code>OS_ExitThread()</code>,
the <code>Mutex</code> locked by that thread is released.</p>



<h3><a name="note6-28">Note 6-28</a>: (OS) Changed the ARM7 component loop process</h3>

<p>The main loop process for the ARM7 component is <code>OS_Halt()</code>.</p>



<h3><a name="note6-29">Note 6-29</a>: (OS) Corrected <code>OS_SetProtectionRegion7()</code> and
<code>OS_SetProtectionRegion7</code></h3>

<p>Corrected so that <code>OS_SetProtectionRegion7()</code>
and <code>OS_SetProtectionRegion7</code> operate on Region 7 rather than Region 6.</p>



<h3><a name="note6-30">Note 6-30: (OS) Added the system clock</a> definition</h3>

<p>Defined the CPU clock values <code>HW_CPU_CLOCK_ARM7</code> and <code>HW_CPU_CLOCK_ARM9</code> for each processor and the CPU
clock value <code>HW_CPU_CLOCK</code> for the current compiler target processor.</p>



<h3><a name="note6-31">Note 6-31</a>: (OS) Changed <code>OS_Panic()</code> termination operation</h3>

<p>Changed the <code>OS_Panic()</code> terminate
operation from <code>OS_Halt</code> 
to <code>OS_Terminate()</code>.</p>



<h3><a name="note6-32">Note 6-32</a>: (OS) Changed the OS demo structure</h3>

<p>Changed the OS demo structure. <code>waitIrq-1</code> and <code>waitIrq-2</code> were added due to this change.</p>

<p>In addition, callTrace-1, callTrace-2, exceptionDisplay-3, functionCost-1, functionCost-2, and functionCost-3 were prepared as demos that do not go in <code>Makefile</code>. These are not included in <code>Makefile</code> because they require that the OS library be compiled using a special option.</p>



<h3><a name="note6-33">Note 6-33</a>: (OS) Changed the IRQ handler</h3>

<p>Due to hardware specifications, a timing problem with enabling/disabling interrupts and IRQ generation caused IME=0 when an IRQ was generated. When this occurs, it exits without doing anything.</p>



<h3><a name="note6-34">Note 6-34</a>: (OS) Added the function call trace and function cost measurement mechanism</h3>

<p>Added a call trace the uses the profile feature of CodeWarrior and a mechanism to measure function costs.</p>

<p>See the following file for an explanation of support for the profile feature by NITRO-SDK.</p>

<pre>    $NitroSDK/docs/TechnicalNotes/MechanismOfProfiler.doc
</pre>



<h3><a name="note6-35">Note 6-35</a>: (OS) Added interrupt check flags for operations</h3>

<p>Prepared the <code>OS_IE_USER_FLAG0</code> and <code>OS_IE_USER_FLAG1</code> check flags, which can be freely used with applications similar to the SDK interrupt causes.</p>



<h3><a name="note6-36">Note 6-36</a>: (SND) Updated the sound library</h3>

<p>The sound library distributed with the NITRO-SDK is version 2004.4.12.</p>



<h3><a name="KnownIssues_1_02_pr1">Known Problems in SDK 1.2 PR1</a></h3>

<p>(To be corrected in the next or a future release)</p>
<ol>
 <li>The archive portion of the file system is a trial

definition</h3>

<p>There was a problem handling code extension in the macro <code>GX_FX16PAIR</code>
in <code>g3.h</code>. This macro was not used elsewhere in the SDK and did not
affect the SDK itself. </p>

<p>This bug has been fixed.</p>

<h3><a name="note1-10">Note 1-10: Support for IS_IRIS_EMULATOR in packaged
library files</a></h3>

<p>Although built library files are bundled in the package, if you used <code>libos.a</code>
in the library as-is, <code>OS_Printf</code> did not output to <code>IS-IRIS-EMULATOR</code>.
When the library was rebuilt in an environment in which <code>IS-IRIS-EMULATOR</code>
had been completely installed, the problem disappeared. </p>

<p>We bundled the corrected library files in a patch.</p>

<p>When linking the ARM7 side processors, if the environment variable &quot;<code>IS_IRIS_DIR</code>&quot;
is not included, it attempts to link <code>libstubsisd.a</code>. However,
because this file did not exist an error occurred. </p>

<p>Added ARM7 version <code>libstubsisd.a</code> and its source file. </p>

<h3><a name="note1-12">Note 1-12: Fixed definition of system reserved region size</a></h3>

<p>The system reserved region size changed (32bytes-&gt;64bytes) with the new
BOOT ROM. This was not supported. </p>

<p>This bug is now fixed. In accord with this, the size of the system mode
stack region has become smaller by 32 bytes. </p>

<h3><a name="note1-13">Note 1-13: </a><a name="note013>Fixed </a><code>G3_LightVector()</code>
setting command position in the GX sample program</h3>

<p>Immediately after it is issued, the <code>G3_LightVector</code> command
performs coordinate conversion using the directional vector matrix. Therefore <code>G3_LightVector()</code>
must be processed after setting the camera matrix. </p>

<p>All samples that use <code>G3_LightVector</code> have been fixed.</p>

<ol start=1 type=1>
 <li>In the test code that performs light processing, the
     values for parameters such as light color are not appropriate. Therefore,
     when polygon surfaces even slightly face the light, light strength becomes
     MAX. </li>
 <li>There is no method for specifying the character base block
     in <code>G2_SetBG*Control256x16Pltt()</code>.</li>
 <li>In the DEBUG version library, assert is generated if you
     set <code>OS_TIMER32_23</code>, as the ID in <code>OS_StartTimer32</code>, or if you set
     <code>OS_TIMER48_123</code> as the ID in <code>OS_StartTimer48()</code>.</li>
