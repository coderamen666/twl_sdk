<h2>Return Values</h2>
<p>Returns the results of the <A href="WMErrCode.html"><CODE>WMErrCode</CODE></A> enumerated type process.</p>

<H2>Description</H2>
<P>Initiates a connection process to a parent. This function is executable only when the WM is in the <code>IDLE</code> state. If the return value for the function is <code>WM_ERRCODE_OPERATING</code>, a callback is triggered when the connection process starts, the request is approved by the parent, and AID was allocated. The callback is also generated when the normal connection state could not be achieved after starting the connection process. When the connection is complete, the WM changes to the <A href="wm_state_diagram.html"><code>CHILD</code> state</A>. After the connection is established, the callback specified by this function is generated when the device is disconnected from the parent. The callback that was specified with this function is also generated if the beacon that was transmitted by the parent on a periodic basis was not received after a set period of time. If the connection process fails along the way and the callback is returned, this indicates that there is an error in the internal state, so try to call the <A href="WM_Reset.html"><CODE>WM_Reset</CODE></A> function before retrying the <A href="WM_StartConnect.html"><CODE>WM_StartConnect</CODE></A> function.</P>

<h2>Note</h2>
<P>
After calling this function, a callback will be generated when the connection as a child device completes as expected, but sometimes before the callback is generated a notification will be generated that shows that there was a beacon receive notification or a disconnect from the parent device. When performing an initialization process, etc., as the child device, perform it before this function is called rather than when the callback has been generated.<br><br> Because the API return value WM_ERRCODE_OVER_MAX_ENTRY sometimes occurs temporarily the instant another inappropriate child device without matching GGID or TGID connects to the parent, we recommend that you retry execution. <br>This problem can arise easily if another IPL child device arrives for a download connection based on the old beacon of the parent device, particularly in the case of connections made immediately before child device program boot during download play.
</P>
<P>The <CODE>pInfo</CODE> data is forcibly stored in the internal cache. To avoid overwriting surrounding memory regions, be sure to pass data that is 32-byte aligned.<BR>See the Wireless Communication Library Manual (AboutWirelessManager.pdf) for additional details.</P>
