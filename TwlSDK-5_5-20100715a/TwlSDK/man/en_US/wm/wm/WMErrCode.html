<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This enumerated type indicates process results that are common to WM operation functions. This enumerated type can also be used jointly as the <CODE>errcode</CODE> member of structures that are passed to the callback functions of asynchronous process functions.
</P>
<P>
These values include some that should be handled as fatal errors and some that should not. To read about the error codes received by various functions and callbacks and about handling the error codes, see &quot;Error Codes Returned by the Wireless Communications Library&quot; list in <I>A Description of the Wireless Communications Library</I>.
