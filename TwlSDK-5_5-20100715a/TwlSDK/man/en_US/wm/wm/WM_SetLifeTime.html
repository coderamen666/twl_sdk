<h2>Return Values</h2>
<p>Returns the results of the <CODE><A href="WMErrCode.html">WMErrCode</A></CODE> enumerated type process.</p>

<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
Sets the communication lifetime (the time until timeout). The function is only executable when the WM is in the <A href="wm_state_diagram.html"><code>IDLE</code> state</A>. If the return value is <code>WM_ERRCODE_OPERATING</code>, a callback is generated after the lifetime setting process is complete. If this function is not called, the default values are 4 seconds for CAM lifetime, 5 beacons for frame lifetime, and 4 seconds for MP communication lifetime.
</P>
<P>
The CAM lifetime is the permissible time during which communications can be interrupted due to deteriorating communication conditions. If the CAM lifetime receives any kind of communication, there is no disconnection.<BR>Basically, the MP communication lifetime displays the value permissible for MP communication interrupt time. The lifetime is updated when a meaningful MP communication is received from a communications partner.<BR>Either way, communications are cut off when the lifetime expires.
</P>
<P>
If the CPU hangs up while the wireless communications hardware is running MP communications, the CAM lifetime is not adequate to properly disconnect. For example, there are cases when the parent continues to send a beacon, or when the child automatically returns a NULL response in the parent MP frame. The MP communications lifetime was prepared to disconnect properly in these situations.
</P>
<P>
The frame lifetime acts differently than the other two lifetimes. It only affects communications during connection and disconnection when running MP communications. In infrastructure mode, the default values affect all frame lifetimes. Do not change them unless there is good reason. In particular, if the frame lifetime is made invalid, conditions could result where the disconnect callback is not called.
