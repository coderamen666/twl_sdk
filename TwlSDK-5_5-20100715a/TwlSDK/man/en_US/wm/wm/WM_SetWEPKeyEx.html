<h2>Return Values</h2>
<p>Returns the results of the <CODE><A href="WMErrCode.html">WMErrCode</A></CODE> enumerated type process.</p>

<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
Configures the encryption feature and the encryption keys. Configure advanced settings with the <A href="WM_SetWEPKey.html"><CODE>WM_SetWEPKey</CODE></A> function. It is executable when WM is in an <A href="wm_state_diagram.html">IDLE state</A>. If the return value of the function was <code>WM_ERRCODE_OPERATING</code>, the callback is generated after the encryption feature configuration process has completed. WEP key encryption is applied to the authentication process when connecting and to the sending and receiving of data in infrastructure mode. The <code>wepmode</code> argument must be configured in the same way as its communications partner. The <CODE>wepkeyid</CODE> argument is used in the selection of the encryption data string when sending data. Conversely, the WEP key of the ID designated by the send side is used in decryption when data is received. Since it can be confirmed that the keys are identical by encrypting the child device and decrypting the parent device in shared key authentication, designation of an ID on the parent device has no real meaning. Also, the IDs of the WEP keys designated by the access point must be identical when encrypting receive data in infrastructure mode. Be aware that when connecting the parent that performed the WEP encryption configuration as a child through this function, once the WEP configurations have been performed with this function, the <code>authMode</code> of the <A href="WM_StartConnectEx.html"><CODE>WM_StartConnectEx</CODE></A> function must be designated as shared key authentication (<code>WM_AUTHMODE_SHARED_KEY</code>).

<P>The <CODE>wepkey</CODE> data is forcibly stored in the internal cache. To avoid overwriting surrounding memory regions, be sure to pass data that is 32-byte aligned.<BR>See the Wireless Communication Library Manual (AboutWirelessManager.pdf) for additional details.</P>
