There is no way to recover from this at run time.

		<H2>Description</H2>
		<P>
			Asynchronously gets a value indicating whether headphones are connected.
		</P>
		<P>
			If this function does not return a value of <CODE>SNDEX_RESULT_SUCCESS</CODE>, the asynchronous processing and callback do not run. Also note that a PXI receive interrupt sends notification when the asynchronous processing is complete, so callbacks do not occur if PXI receive interrupts are prohibited.
