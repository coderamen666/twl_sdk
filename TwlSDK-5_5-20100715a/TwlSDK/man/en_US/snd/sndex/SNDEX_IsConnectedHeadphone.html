There is no way to recover from this at run time.

		<H2>Description</H2>
		<P>
			Asynchronously gets a value indicating whether headphones are connected.
		</P>
		<P>
			This function calls the <A href="SNDEX_IsConnectedHeadphoneAsync.html"><code>SNDEX_IsConnectedHeadphoneAsync</code></A> function internally and stops its own calling thread until asynchronous processing has completed. This function expects to be called from a thread, so it fails if it is called from an exception handler. Note that this function continues to block internally if PXI receive interrupts are prohibited, because PXI receive interrupts are used to detect the processing's completion.
