		<H2>Description</H2>
		<P>
			Sets the IIR filters (from 1 to 5 stages) to apply to audio data input from the microphone. This function must be called once for each filter stage being set in a multistage filter.<BR>After configuration is complete, the user-specified callback function will be invoked.
		</P>
        <P>
To generate parameters for a low-pass filter, high-pass filter, band-pass filter, and band-elimination filter, use <CODE>$TwlSDK/docs/TechnicalNotes/IIR_FilterBuilder.xls</CODE>. However, you cannot calculate parameters by specifying characteristics of the filter. See <A href="doc/aboutIirFilterBuilder.html">How to Use IIR_FilterBuilder</A> for more details.
        </P>
        <P>
If this function does not return a value of <CODE>SNDEX_RESULT_SUCCESS</CODE>, the asynchronous processing and callback will not be run.<BR>Also note that a PXI receive interrupt will send notification when the asynchronous processing is complete, so callbacks will not occur if PXI receive interrupts are prohibited.</P>

<P>To maintain the shutter sound playback volume, this function returns <CODE>SNDEX_RESULT_ILLEGAL_STATE</CODE> and quits without doing anything while the <A href="../../dsp/common/DSP_PlayShutterSound.html"><CODE>DSP_PlayShutterSound</CODE></A> function is executing.<BR>The library initializes the IIR filter settings while the shutter sound is playing and then reconfigures the settings after playback has finished.</P>

<P>The system will wait for the IIR filters to finish being set before either entering sleep mode or performing hardware reset. For more information, see the <A href="../../spi/pm/about_sleep.html">Sleep</A> and <A href="../../spi/pm/about_exit.html">Hardware Reset and Shutdown</A> overviews.</P>
		<H2>Note</H2>
        <P>
You can only set one IIR filter stage at a time. This function will return a <CODE>SNDEX_RESULT_EXCLUSIVE</CODE> error if it is called again while an IIR filter is currently being set.
        </P>
<P>It takes somewhere between 10 and several hundred milliseconds to set a single IIR filter stage.<FONT color="red">While it is being set, SPI mutexes will be used on the ARM7. During this time, microphone sampling, Touch Screen sampling, power management, and NVRAM will be forced to wait, causing delays.</FONT>Accordingly, use caution when using the devices listed above in parallel with this function.</P>
        <P>
			<B><FONT color="red">You must take special care when setting IIR filter parameters. </FONT></B> If you configure an IIR filter to increase the gain of input audio data, some input sources will cause the calculation results to be saturated (topped out at the maximum value) and hence distort the sound. As a basic rule, with uncertain input sources IIR filters should be used to reduce the gain. When setting multiple IIR filters, make sure no stage is saturated. This is because filters will be applied in order, one stage at a time, to the input waveform (see <A href="SNDEXIirFilterTarget.html"><CODE>SNDEXIirFilterTarget</CODE></A> for information on the order in which filters are applied). In particular, because IIR filters use previous output data, setting parameters to amplify it may cause sound to be emitted from the speakers regardless of the system volume or mute state set by the <A href="SNDEX_SetMute.html"><CODE>SNDEX_SetMute</CODE></A> function.
		</P>
		<P>Restrictions will be applied depending on the filter target <SPAN class="argument">target</SPAN> when this function is used.</P>
		<P><FONT color="red">When <SPAN class="argument">target</SPAN> indicates microphone input data (<CODE>SNDEX_IIR_FILTER_ADC_*</CODE>), proper sampling data cannot be obtained because the A/D converter is stopped during configuration.</FONT>Because it is acceptable to simply avoid using the sampling data from this interval, microphone sampling itself does not need to be stopped.</P>
