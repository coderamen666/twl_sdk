This may occur when an illegal PXI command was sent directly, ignoring library state management; when the ARM7 component and the extended sound feature library have different versions; when library state management has fallen into an abnormal state due to memory corruption; or when other such conditions arise. There is no way to recover from this at run time.

		<H2>Description</H2>
		<P>
			Asynchronously changes the speaker volume. <FONT color="red">The changes are not necessarily applied immediately.</FONT> For more information, see <B>Note</B>, below.
		</P>
		<P>
			In addition to this function, the <A href="SNDEX_SetVolume.html"><CODE>SNDEX_SetVolume</CODE></A> function and the console's volume switch can be used to change the speaker volume. The console will record the changed value and will also apply it at the next restart.
		</P>
		<P>
			If this function does not return a value of <CODE>SNDEX_RESULT_SUCCESS</CODE>, the asynchronous processing and callback will not be run. Also note that a PXI receive interrupt will send notification when the asynchronous processing is complete, so callbacks will not occur if PXI receive interrupts are prohibited.
		</P>

		<H2>Note</H2>
		<P>
		Be sure that your method for changing the volume adheres to the <I>Programming Guidelines</I>.<BR>
		</P>
		<P>
			The speaker volume is saved in dedicated nonvolatile memory each time it is changed. It consequently cannot be modified an infinite number of times.<FONT color="red">Avoid frequent changes to the speaker volume from the program.</FONT>
		</P>
		<P>
			The library controls the execution of this function to control the number times the volume is changed.<BR> If the function is called during the roughly 10 frames (approximately 167 ms) since the volume was last changed, the new value is not immediately applied but instead held pending. Even if this is the case, the function returns <CODE>SNDEX_RESULT_SUCCESS</CODE>.<BR> When the storage time for this pending change has ended, the speaker volume is changed to the value specified in the argument of the last-called <code>SNDEX_SetVolume[Async]</code> function.<BR> The value returned by the <A href="SNDEX_GetVolume.html"><CODE>SNDEX_GetVolume[Async]</CODE></A> function is the pending change to the speaker volume. If no value is pending, the currently set speaker volume is returned.
		</P>
		<P>
			The callback function specified in the argument of this function is called when the function process ends, <FONT color="red">not when the change to speaker volume is actually applied.</FONT>
		</P>
