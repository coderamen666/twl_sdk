		<H2>Description</H2>
		<P>
			Synchronously changes the I2S operating frequency. The I2S operating frequency is set to <CODE>SNDEX_FREQUENCY_32730</CODE> by default.
		</P>
		<P>
			This function calls the <A href="SNDEX_SetI2SFrequencyAsync.html"><CODE>SNDEX_SetI2SFrequencyAsync</CODE></A> function internally and stops its own calling thread until asynchronous processing has completed. This function expects to be called from a thread, so it fails if it is called from an exception handler. Note that this function continues to block internally if PXI receive interrupts are prohibited, because PXI receive interrupts are used to detect the processing's completion.
		</P>

		<H2>Notes</H2>
		<P>
			Changing to the I2S operating frequency also entails change synchronization of the communications clock with respect to CPU-external devices. Sound output features and CODEC-related features are all affected as a result.<FONT color="red">Switch the frequency only after stopping all of the following: audio output from the CPU and DSP, touch panel input sampling, microphone input sampling, and microphone input sampling from the DSP.</FONT>
