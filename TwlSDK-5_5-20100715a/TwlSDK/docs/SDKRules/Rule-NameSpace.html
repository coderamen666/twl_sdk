<H1>Basic Rules for Naming Functions and Variables</H1>
<H2>Categories</H2>
<P>TWL-SDK functions can be grouped into categories according to their purpose. They have been given names that help make these categories clear.</P>
<DL>
  <DT>Categories
  <DD>A category is indicated with two or more uppercase letters. (Numerals can also be used starting in the second position, but only for items related to graphics.)
  <DD>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>Syntax: [A-Z][A-Z0-9]+</BLOCKQUOTE>
</DL>
<TABLE border="1" width="100%">
  <COL span="1" width="100">
  <TBODY>
    <TR>
      <TH align="left">OS</TH>
      <TD>Items related to the operating system.</TD>
    </TR>
    <TR>
      <TH align="left">G2,G3,GX...</TH>
      <TD>Items related to graphics. (Numerals are also included.)</TD>
    </TR>
    <TR>
      <TH align="left">MI</TH>
      <TD>Items related to memory exchange, such as DMA.</TD>
    </TR>
    <TR>
      <TH align="left">SVC</TH>
      <TD>Items related to system calls.</TD>
    </TR>
  </TBODY>
</TABLE>
<P align="right">(03/11/13)</P>
<P align="left">Note: The distinction in the main processor and subprocessor categories was eliminated. Uppercase letters are used uniformly and consistently.</P>
<P align="right">(04/01/18)</P>
<H2>Functions</H2>
<P>Functions are named as follows: Subject and object are connected without an underscore. The first letter of each separate word is capitalized.</P>
<DL>
  <DT>Public functions
  <DD>[Category name]_[verb] [object, and so on]
  <DD>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>Examples: OS_SetInterruptMask, OS_IsLocked</BLOCKQUOTE>
</DL>
<DL>
  <DT>Private functions
  <DD>[Category name]i_[verb] [object, etc]
  <DD>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>Example: OSi_SetInterruptMaskBase</BLOCKQUOTE>
</DL>
<DL>
  <DT>Static functions
  <DD>Free form
</DL>
<P>However, there are some functions that do not follow these rules, such as <CODE>OS_InterruptHandler</CODE>.  </P>
<P align="right">(03/11/13)</P>
<P>There are two different names that can be given to a function that generates or initializes objects: <CODE>Create</CODE> or <CODE>Init</CODE>. <CODE>Create</CODE> is used when a function must later be called to explicitly destroy the object. <CODE>Init</CODE> is used when when the object does not need to be destroyed.</P>
<P align="right">(03/12/15)</P>
<H2>Variable Type Name</H2>
<P>Functions and types are the same since the name used in typedefs fundamentally adhere to Nintendo&nbsp;GameCube conventions. Note that a verb is not used after the category name.</P>
<DL>
  <DT>Variable type name
  <DD>[Category name] [noun]
  <DD>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>Example: OSInterruptCallback</BLOCKQUOTE>
</DL>
<DL>
  <DT>Variable name exceptions
  <DD>[Category name] [verb] Mode
  <DD>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>Example: OSCopyMode</BLOCKQUOTE>
</DL>
<P>As an exception, names such as <CODE>OSCopyMode</CODE> are given to functions used to control the operations of the API itself. This particular function, for example, is likely to control the operation of a function with a name like <CODE>GXCopy</CODE>. Names such as <CODE>GXCopyStatus</CODE> and <CODE>GXCopyType</CODE> are other possibilities. Although this is recognized as a natural way to name such functions, do not take this concept too far.</P>
<P align="right">(03/11/13)</P>
<H2>Enumerator Names and Macro Names</H2>
<P>Constants defined by <CODE>enum</CODE>, <CODE>define</CODE>, and <CODE>const</CODE> have the format shown below.</P>
<DL>
  <DT>Constant Name
  <DD>[Category name] _ [A-Z0-9_]+
  <DD>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>Examples: OS_INTERRUPT_MAX, OS_INTERRUPT_MAX</BLOCKQUOTE>
</DL>
