      Deleted target values for speaker output from SNDEX_SetIirFilterAsync and SNDEX_SetIirFilter functions.


    - (TOOL) Fixed bug where mb_child_TWL.srl debug log would not be output

    - (WM) Fixed bug where the parent device channel would be invalid when starting DS wireless communication in TWL mode.

      Fixed a bug where the channel obtainable by the child device scanning would be different from the channel on which the parent device is actually transmitting. This would occur after stopping the DS wireless communication and then immediately calling either the WM_Initialize function again or calling the WM_PowerOn function to initialize the DS wireless communication.

    --------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - (DevEnv) Changed makelcf[.TWL]

      There was a bug where library and filenames that specified force parameters would not be recognized if the name contained two or more periods. This has been fixed.


    - (NA) Prohibiting the Flip Setting in Sub-Banners

      Due to a bug in the CTR HOME Menu, the flip setting for sub-banners has been prohibited.
      When a flip setting is entered, note that NA_SaveSubBanner will return an error.

      In addition, to reflect this change, the demos.TWL/nandApp/SubBanner sub-banner demo has been revised.


    - (TOOL) Prohibiting the Flip Setting for TWL Banners

      Due to a bug in the CTR HOME Menu, the flip setting for TWL banners has been prohibited.
      When a previously used flip setting is entered, note that bannercvtr and makebanner.TWL will return an error.

      In addition the demos.TWL/tips/TWLBanner_anim2 TWL banner demo has been revised to reflect this change.

    - (TOOL) Rolled back version of commondefs

      TWL-SDK 5.5 added support in commondefs for file paths that have parentheses, but this added processing caused build times with TWL-SDK 5.5 to take much longer than with TWL-SDK 5.4. The version of commondefs has been rolled back to an equivalent of that provided with TWL-SDK 5.4.
      
      In situations requiring a version of commondefs that supports parentheses in file paths (such as in 64-bit Windows environments where the compiler or debugger is installed below the "Program Files(x86)" directory), replace commondefs with a renamed version of the "commondefs.parens" file provided in the same directory.
