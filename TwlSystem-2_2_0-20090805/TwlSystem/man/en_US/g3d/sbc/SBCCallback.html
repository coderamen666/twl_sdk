<h1 align="left">SBC and Callbacks</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<P>The calculation for the rendering and animation is performed by processing the stream of multiple types of (user definable) SBC (structure byte code) byte code commands inside the model resource binary when <code>NNS_G3dDraw</code> executes. The SBC includes elements that: define the parent / child relationship of the joint, designate the material to be used, and designate the primitive to be rendered. Rendering and animation is performed by appropriately interpreting them at execution time.<BR><BR>Below is a table summarizing each of the SBC commands. The first byte of each command is split into 5-bit and 3-bit fields. The former corresponds to each SBC command, and its variations are designated by the latter. There are also cases in which each command has several arguments.

<P>For each command, a maximum of three points in the process (timings) can be configured for callbacks. One callback can be set to each command. When you want to use only one callback, it can be designated by using the <code>NNS_G3dRenderObjSetCallBack</code> function. When you want to use multiple callbacks, multiple callbacks can be registered by registering the callback function that is executed immediately before rendering by using the <A href="../kernel/NNS_G3dRenderObjSetInitFunc.html" target="_self"><CODE>NNS_G3dRenderObjSetInitFunc</CODE></A> function, and using the <A href="NNSG3dRS.html#NNS_G3dRSSetCallBack" target="_self"><CODE>NNS_G3dRSSetCallBack</CODE></A> function in the callback function. Refer to the descriptions of each command for information about what sorts of applications are appropriate for each timing.</P>
