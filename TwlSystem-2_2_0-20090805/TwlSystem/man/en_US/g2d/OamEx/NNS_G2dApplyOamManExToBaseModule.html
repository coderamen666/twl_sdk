<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
Calls OAM registered functions to an external module to apply the Extended OAM Manager's contents to the actual hardware. This function calls the registration functions set by the <code>NNS_G2dSetOamManExEntryFunctions</code> function using the various elements in the Manager entity's internal registration OAM list as arguments.<BR>At this time as described above, the registration functions are called in the display priority order that was specified during OAM registration. </p>


<H2>Note on the Render Order for OAM Groups with the Same Display Priority</H2>
<P>OAM groups with the same display priority are managed internally by the manager, with lists.
The manager calls and processes registration functions starting from the top of the internal list and then works toward the end.
Because the OAM adds registration functions to the the top of the list as they are registered, registration functions are called in the reverse order of the order they were registered.
OAMs that have undergone affine transformation are managed on a separate list in the manager,
and they are moved to the top of the normal OAM list after the actual affine parameter numbers have been resolved when the <CODE>NNS_G2dApplyOamManExToBaseModule</CODE> function is called.
Accordingly, OAMs that have undergone affine transformation in OAM groups with the same display priority will be called before OAMs that have not undergone affine transformation.
Therefore, registered function calls occurs before OAM that have not undergone affine transformation.</p>

<P>
The name of this function has been changed from <code>NNS_G2dApplyToBaseModuleEx</code>. The previous function remains under a different name to maintain compatibility.
