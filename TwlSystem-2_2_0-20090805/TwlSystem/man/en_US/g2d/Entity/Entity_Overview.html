<H2>Description</H2>
Entities are defined with the concept of managing and storing information from higher-level layers (user programs) than the cell animation and multicell animation data structures.<BR>Entities are located in the highest-level layer in which data structures are defined internally in G2D. Therefore, in future versions there may be changes to this layer when features of the higher-level layers (user programs) are expanded. <BR>



<h2>Internal Data of Entity</h2>

Entities contain the following information.
<h3>Pointer to Entity Data</h3>
The pointer to the entity data (<code>.nenr</code> file) read to the main memory is stored here. Entity data is static&mdash;it will not be rewritten.

<h3>Sequence Number Being Played</h3>
The sequence number of the animation that is currently playing is stored here. The Animation Sequence Number corresponds to the sequence number of the animation in the entity data designated by the pointer to the entity data.

<h3>Pointer to the Display Data</h3>
The pointer to the cell or multicell animation currently being rendered is stored here.

<h3>Pointer to the Color Palette Conversion Table</h3>
There may be situations where different characters are expressed by changing the color palette used by the same character so a table exists for converting color palettes. The color palette conversion table specifies which color palette number from the sixteen color palettes it is changed to.
