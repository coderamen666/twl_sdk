<h3 id="note_03-Y08">Note 03-Y08:   Fixed bug where volume_min, volume_max, and volume_r in IMD files were not output correctly</h3>
<p>Although values where volume_min, volume_max, and volume_r given for &lt;node&gt; in IMD files were multiplied by 2 to the power of pos_scale, an unmultiplied value is now used.

<h2 id="version_20040212">Changes in Version 2004/02/12</h2>
<h3 id="note_02-Y01">Note 02-Y01:   Changed such that all quadrilateral polygons in Maya are output as quadrilaterals</h3>
<p>Quadrilateral polygons and convex quadrilateral polygons where all vertices are not in the same plane are no longer cut into triangular strips. Now quadrilateral polygons in Maya are all output as quadrilaterals. If hardware cannot display them properly, perform the appropriate triangle partitioning in Maya.
</p>
<h3 id="note_02-Y02">Note 02-Y02:   Added support for changing the number of surfaces after skinning</h3>
<p>Support for changing the number of surfaces after skinning has been added. Operations such as triangle partitioning after skinning is now possible. However, just as in the past, the number of vertices cannot be changed.
</p>
<h3 id="note_02-Y03">Note 02-Y03:  Changed processing when the number of colors in a 4x4 texel compressed texture palette exceeds 32768</h3>
<p>Revised such that image quality is lowered and palettes are compressed to 32768 colors or less when the number of colors of a palette for a 4x4 texel compressed texture exceeds 32768.
</p>

<h3 id="note_01-Y01">Note 01-Y01:   Changed the effective number of lines for the Magnify and Tolerance export options (except Color)</h3>
<p>The effective number of lines for the Magnify and Tolerance export options (except Color) has been changed up to the 10,000th-place digit.
</p>
<h3 id="note_01-Y02">Note 01-Y02:   Fixed bug where Maya would crash depending on animation export conditions</h3>
<p>A bug where Maya would crash when a texture SRT animation was set and another animation file was exported without outputting ITA has been fixed.
